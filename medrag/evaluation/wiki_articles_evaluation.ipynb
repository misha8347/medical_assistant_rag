       "['**Stroke**\\n\\nA stroke is a medical condition that occurs when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted or reduced, depriving the brain of oxygen and nutrients. This can lead to damage to the brain tissue, resulting in various neurological symptoms.\\n\\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\\n\\nThe causes of stroke are varied, but common risk factors include:\\n\\n*   High blood pressure\\n*   Diabetes\\n*   Smoking\\n*   Obesity\\n*   Physical inactivity\\n*   Family history of stroke or cardiovascular disease\\n\\nAccording to the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association, continuous ECG monitoring and assessment of LV function (ECHO) and cardiac injury biomarkers are crucial for cardiac monitoring, especially during the first 24 hours. This helps screen for any myocardial damage to prevent sudden cardiac death.\\n\\n**Diagnosis**\\n\\nThe diagnosis of stroke involves a combination of clinical evaluation, imaging tests, and laboratory studies. The American Stroke Association recommends the use of dual cardio-cerebral approach in the first 3-5 days.\\n\\n*   **Computed Tomography (CT) Scan**: A CT scan is often used to evaluate acute ischemic strokes.\\n*   **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)**: MRI is useful for evaluating ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, as well as assessing infarct size and location.\\n*   **Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI)**: DWI is a type of MRI that can help identify acute ischemic strokes.\\n\\n**Treatment**\\n\\nThe primary goal of treatment for stroke is to restore blood flow to the affected area of the brain. This can be achieved through:\\n\\n*   **Thrombectomy**: A procedure that removes blood clots from the carotid arteries using a stent retriever or aspiration catheter.\\n*   **Mechanical Thrombectomy**: A procedure that uses a mechanical device to remove blood clots from the carotid arteries.\\n*   **Anticoagulation Therapy**: Medications such as heparin and warfarin are used to prevent further blood clots.\\n\\n**Complications**\\n\\nStroke can lead to various complications, including:\\n\\n*   **Disability**: Stroke can result in significant disability, with approximately 3 million people in the United States living with some form of stroke-related disability.\\n*   **Mortality**: Stroke is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for over 800,000 deaths annually.\\n\\n**Prognosis**\\n\\nThe prognosis for stroke patients varies depending on several factors, including:\\n\\n*   **Time to Treatment**: The sooner treatment is initiated, the better the outcome.\\n*   **Location and Size of Infarct**: The location and size of the infarct can affect outcomes.\\n*   **Patient\\'s Overall Health**: Patients with underlying health conditions may have a poorer prognosis.\\n\\n**References**\\n\\n1.  \"2019 Guidelines for the Management of Acute Ischemic Stroke: A Guideline for Healthcare Providers from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association.\" Journal of Stroke and Cerebrovascular Diseases, vol. 28, no. 10, pp. e281-e491.\\n2.  \"American Heart Association/American Stroke Association Guidelines for the Early Management of Acute Ischemic Stroke: A Guideline for Healthcare Providers from the American Heart Association/Society of NeuroInterventional Surgery and the American Academy of Neurology.\" Journal of Stroke and Cerebrovascular Diseases, vol. 28, no. 10, pp. e281-e491.\\n3.  \"International Stroke Conference 2019: 14th International Conference on Vascular Malformations and Brain Arteriovenous Malformations.\" Journal of Neurosurgery, vol. 130, no. 5, pp. 1211-1224.\\n4.  \"The Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score: A Tool for Early Prediction of Outcome in Acute Ischemic Stroke.\" Stroke, vol. 45, no. 8, pp. 2133-2140.\\n5.  \"Early Computed Tomography Score ≤6 Predicts Mortality and Disability after Thrombectomy for Acute Anterior Circulation Stroke.\" Neurology, vol. 92, no. 20, pp. e230-e238.\\n\\nIn conclusion, stroke is a complex medical condition that requires prompt treatment to restore blood flow to the affected area of the brain. Early diagnosis and treatment can significantly improve outcomes and reduce disability and mortality.',\n",
       " '**Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)**\\n\\nA transient ischemic attack (TIA), also known as a mini-stroke, is a temporary interruption of blood flow to the brain that lasts for a short period, usually less than 24 hours. It is often described as a \"mini-stroke\" or a \"stroke warning sign.\" TIAs are considered a warning sign for a future stroke and can be an opportunity to prevent a full-blown stroke.\\n\\n**Causes and Risk Factors**\\n\\nThe exact cause of a TIA is not always known, but it is believed to result from a temporary blockage in the blood vessels supplying blood to the brain.

It is used for the treatment of acute ischemic strokes and has been studied for its potential use in other medical conditions.\\n\\n**Mechanism of Action**\\n\\ntPA works by activating plasminogen, a protein that plays a key role in blood clotting. When tPA binds to plasminogen, it converts it into plasmin, which then breaks down clots and fibrinogen, a protein that helps form blood clots.\\n\\n**Indications for Use**\\n\\ntPA is used for the treatment of acute ischemic strokes, particularly when administered within 90 minutes of symptom onset. It has also been studied for its potential use in mechanical thrombectomy, a procedure used to remove blood clots from arteries.\\n\\n**Studies and Pilot Studies**\\n\\nSeveral studies have investigated the use of tPA in treating angioedema after thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator. A pilot study published in [1] examined the safety and efficacy of administering tPA within 90 minutes of symptom onset. Another study [2] evaluated the use of tPA in mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke.\\n\\n**Use in Intra-abdominal Infections**\\n\\ntPA has been used to treat intra-abdominal infections, including infected fluid collections.

The interruption of blood flow can be caused by various factors, including blood clots, blockages, or other vascular abnormalities.\\n\\n**Causes and Etiopathogenesis**\\n\\nThe exact cause of cerebral infarction is often difficult to determine, but several mechanisms have been proposed. One possible mechanism is the massive release of blood and blood breakdown products into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and subsequent inflammatory changes in the smooth muscle of the large cerebral arteries. This can lead to a decrease in blood flow to the brain, resulting in tissue damage.\\n\\n**Risk Factors**\\n\\nSeveral risk factors have been identified that increase the likelihood of developing a cerebral infarction. These include:\\n\\n*   **Hypertension**: High blood pressure is a major risk factor for stroke.\\n*   **Diabetes**: People with diabetes are at increased risk of developing a stroke.\\n*   **Smoking**: Smoking is a significant risk factor for stroke, as it can damage the blood vessels and increase blood pressure.\\n*   **Obesity**: Being overweight or obese increases the risk of stroke.\\n*   **Family history**: A family history of stroke increases an individual's risk.\\n\\n**Management**\\n\\nThe management of cerebral infarction depends on the location, size, and severity of the infarct. In general, treatment may include:\\n\\n*   **Thrombolytic therapy**: Medications that dissolve blood clots can be administered to restore blood flow to the brain.\\n*   **Anticoagulation**: Blood thinners may be prescribed to prevent further clot formation.\\n*   **Surgery**: In some cases, surgery may be necessary to relieve pressure on the brain or repair damaged blood vessels.\\n\\n**References**\\n\\n*   American Heart Association.

       " '**Embolic Stroke of Undetermined Source**\\n\\nAn embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS) is a type of ischemic stroke where the cause of the stroke cannot be determined despite thorough evaluation.\\n\\n**Definition and Epidemiology**\\n\\nESUS is defined as an acute ischemic stroke with no identifiable source, such as cardioembolism, large artery atherosclerosis, or venous thromboembolism (1). The exact prevalence of ESUS varies depending on the population studied, but it is estimated to occur in approximately 20-30% of all ischemic strokes (2).\\n\\n**Clinical Presentation**\\n\\nPatients with ESUS often present with typical symptoms of an ischemic stroke, such as sudden onset of focal neurological deficits, headache, and sometimes fever (3). The severity of the stroke can vary widely, from mild hemiparesis to severe, disabling stroke.\\n\\n**Evaluation and Management**\\n\\nThe management of ESUS is similar to that of other types of ischemic strokes. Patients are usually evaluated with a comprehensive medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies such as non-contrast CT or MRI (4). In some cases, additional testing may be performed to rule out a source of embolism, such as echocardiography (TEE) or venous thromboembolism screening (5).\\n\\n**Hypercoagulability Evaluation**\\n\\nA hypercoagulable evaluation is sometimes performed in patients with ESUS to identify potential underlying causes of the stroke, such as inherited coagulation disorders or autoimmune conditions (6). However, the yield of this testing is variable and may not lead to a definitive diagnosis (7).\\n\\n**Role of Repeat TEE**\\n\\nThe role of repeat Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE) in the evaluation of ESUS is uncertain. Some studies suggest that TEE may be useful in identifying cardiac sources of embolism, but other studies have found no significant benefit or even increased risk of bleeding with repeat TEE (8).\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nESUS is a challenging diagnosis to make, and the choice of diagnostic testing can be difficult. While hypercoagulability evaluation and TEE may be considered in certain cases, their role remains uncertain and should be individualized based on patient presentation and clinical context.\\n\\nReferences:\\n\\n1.
