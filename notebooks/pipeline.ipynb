       "array(['Echocardiographic assessment and percutaneous closure of multiple atrial septal defects Atrial septal defect closure is now routinely performed using a percutaneous approach under echocardiographic guidance. Centrally located, secundum defects are ideal for device closure but there is considerable morphological variation in size and location of the defects. A small proportion of atrial septal defects may have multiple fenestrations and these are often considered unsuitable for device closure. We report three cases of multiple atrial septal defects successfully closed with two Amplatzer septal occluders. Introduction Atrial septal defect (ASD) closure is now commonly performed using a transcatheter, percutaneous approach and with the Amplatzer septal occluder, large defects can be safely closed. Device deployment requires a rim of atrial septal tissue surrounding the defect to allow effective capture of the septum by the occluder. The rim of tissue is also important to separate the septal occluder from important structures including the inferior vena cava, coronary sinus and the atrioventricular valves. The majority of patients require a single device for closure of the ASD but a small proportion of patients may have more than one defect in the atrial septum. This can be difficult to diagnose using transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) as abnormal colour flow obscures the origins of the shunt, particularly if the second defect is situated inferiorly. We report three cases of patients referred for ASD closures that were found to have multiple ASDs and the techniques used to close these defects. Case 1 A 34-year old woman was referred for consideration of percutaneous ASD closure. The ASD had been diagnosed when the patient was 12 years old and TTE had suggested that the right ventricle was dilating. At cardiac catheterisation there were mildly elevated right ventricular systolic pressures and a pulmonary to systemic flow ratio of over two. The secundum ASD was estimated to be 15 mm wide using TTE with aneurysmal formation of the interatrial septum. The patient was admitted for percutaneous ASD closure and underwent uncomplicated placement of a 17 mm Amplatzer septal occluder. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) during the procedure revealed the presence of a second ASD near the inferior vena cava and a small post-procedure shunt. The septal occluder did not completely cover both defects. Equivalent chest x-ray radiation dose (assuming a single posteroanterior projection chest x-ray is eight centi-Gray/cm2) was 400. Repeat TTE continued to demonstrate left to right shunting and the patient was readmitted for a further device closure six months later. At cardiac catheterisation, the second defect was identified low in the secundum septum between the fossa ovalis and the mouth of the coronary sinus. The defect was successfully closed with a 9 mm Amplatzer septal occluder with no evidence of obstructed flow in either the coronary sinus or the inferior vena cava. Equivalent chest x-ray radiation dose for the second procedure was 187. The patient remained well with no evidence of residual shunt six months following the procedure. Case 2 A 31-year old woman was found to have a secundum ASD during investigations for breathlessness. The defect was estimated to be 10 mm wide on TTE with evidence of right atrial and right ventricular dilatation. Left atrial size was normal. She was referred was further investigation and treatment. Cardiac catheterisation demonstrated a pulmonary to systemic flow shunt of four to one. Peri-procedure TEE revealed that there were two defects; one measuring 24 mm located inferiorly between the inferior vena cava and coronary sinus os with the second defect situated superiorly and measuring 30 mm. The inferior defect was closed using a 24 mm Amplatzer septal occluder. Equivalent chest x-ray radiation dose was 403. The patient was discharged the following day and readmitted three months later for closure of the superior defect. This was performed using a 30 mm Amplatzer septal occluder. The procedure was technical difficult as after deployment of the left sided disc, the device initially lay obliquely in the defect. The final position was satisfactory with no evidence of intra-cardiac shunting (figure 1). There was no interference between the two devices and mitral valve function remained normal. Equivalent chest x-ray radiation dose for the second procedure was 727. The patient remained well and at six month follow-up there was no evidence of residual shunt. Stored fluoroscopy following placement of the two Amplatzer septal occluders (ASOs). TEE – Transesophageal echocardiography probe. Case 3 A 30-year old woman was investigated for palpitations and a secundum ASD of approximately 20 mm was diagnosed. TEE suggested that the atrial septum was fenestrated with a small inferior rim of tissue and she was referred for device closure. At cardiac catheterisation it became clear that there were two principal defects, one in the fossa ovalis and the other situated inferior and posterior between the fossa ovalis and the coronary sinus. The superior hole was closed with a 16 mm Amplatzer septal occluder but failed to cover the inferior defect. A 15 mm Amplatzer septal occluder device was subsequently placed successfully across the inferior defect with a stable position (figure 2). Equivalent chest x-ray radiation dose for the procedure was 124. Subsequent follow-up revealed a small left to right shunt between the two septal occluders but further intervention was not considered necessary. Transesophageal echocardiography four-chamber image following deployment of the two Amplatzer septal occluders (ASO). LA – left atrium, LV – left ventricle, RA – right atrium, RV – right ventricle. Discussion There is considerable morphological variation of secundum-type ASDs. Podnar et al reported the echocardiographic findings of 190 patients with isolated secundum ASDs referred for device closure. Twenty four per cent had centrally placed defects but the remaining 144 patients had morphological variations. A deficient superior anterior rim was seen in 42%, a deficient inferior posterior rim in 10%, perforated aneurysm of the interatrial septum was seen in 7.9% and 7.3% of patients had multiple septal defects. Experience of multiple ASDs closure using more than one Amplatzer septal occluder remains limited. In the worldwide report of use of the Amplatzer septal occluder, 3460 patients received a single device but only 45 patients received two devices for multiple ASDs. Cao et al reported a series of 22 patients who had two septal occluders implanted simultaneously for multiple ASDs. Closure rate was 97.7% with one device embolisation. In closely positioned multiple defects the septal occluder should be implanted in the largest defect aiming to cover any smaller defects but in widely separated defects more than one device is required. Echocardiographic studies have suggested that patients with multiple ASDs should have a rim of tissue of more than seven millimetres between defects to allow the deployment of two septal occluders. Continuous echocardiographic monitoring is required for device positioning. When TEE is used, patients usually require a general anaesthetic due to the prolonged oesophageal intubation. The development of intracardiac echocardiography now provides an alternative to TEE for device closure. Benefits include more detailed imaging, a reduced need for general anaesthesia, and reduced radiation exposure. In particular, use of intracardiac echocardiography allows clearer visualisation of the inferior atrial septum. Three-dimensional echocardiography may allow more detailed assessment of multiple ASD anatomy and septal occluder positioning. One question that remains unclear is whether multiple septal occluders should be deployed simultaneously or implanted as staged procedures. Serious complications during single septal occluder implantation is a rare occurrence (less than 0.3% of cases) but it likely that simultaneous deployment will increase the procedure risk. When implanting large devices (greater than 20 mm) with little septal separation it is favourable to deploy the larger device and bring the patient back for a further procedure once the device has stabilised. Conclusions There is considerable variation in atrial septal defect anatomy. A small proportion of patients with an ASD have more than one defect and these can be closed using conventional septal occluders under transoesophageal echocardiography guidance. The use of intracardiac echocardiography should allow more accurate device positioning, particularly defects located low in the atrial septum.

       "       'A unique dedifferentiated tumor of the retroperitoneum Background Dedifferentiated liposarcomas represent heterogeneous tumors with lipomatous and nonlipomatous elements starkly juxtaposed. It is thought that the high grade nonlipomatous elements of the tumor portend a worse prognosis. Case Presentation A 19.8 kg heterogeneous retroperitoneal tumor was successfully and completely resected. Because of its extent, no additional treatment modalities were practicable. The tumor soon recurred. The recurrent tumor differed from the primary tumor in that it was more homogeneous, consisting mainly of nonlipogenic, calcific tissue. Conclusions Dedifferentiated liposarcomas are known to have a very high recurrence rate. The biological behavior of dedifferentiated liposarcomas is likely dictated by the most aggressive element of these heterogeneous tumors. Background Sarcomas arising from the retroperitoneum are rare tumors, accounting for 10–15% of all soft tissue sarcomas. Liposarcoma is the single most common soft tissue sarcoma and accounts for at least 20% of all sarcomas in adults. Classification of liposarcoma into four types, based on morphologic features and cytogenic aberrations, is now widely accepted. These four types are (a) well differentiated; (b) dedifferentiated; (c) myxoid/round cell and (d) pleomorphic. The extent of differentiation, as reflected by histological grade, remains the most important determinant of clinical course and of ultimate prognosis for patients with liposarcoma after resection. The following case illustrates the great morphological and biological heterogeneity of these tumors. A very rapid recurrence was observed, and this recurrence was considerably less heterogeneous than the primary tumor, consisting mainly of the calcific, nonlipomatous component. Case presentation A 65-year-old male presented with a three-week history of progressively worsening abdominal distension. He denied any abdominal pain but stated that he noticed an increased frequency of bowel movements. His past medical history was unremarkable. On examination, he was afebrile and had a hugely distended abdomen with an immobile, nontender mass occupying all four quadrants of the abdomen. Computed tomographic (CT) scan revealed a large, heterogeneous lobulated mass occupying most of the abdomen (Figure 1). The peripheral component appeared lipomatous and the margins of this component were difficult to estimate accurately. There was also a heterogeneous nonlipomatous component that contained areas of lesser density, as well as a central stellate region of calcifications. The preoperative differential diagnosis included a retroperitoneal sarcoma (especially dedifferentiated liposarcoma), desmoid tumor, undifferentiated carcinoma, carcinoid or sclerosing mesenteritis; lymphoma was also considered. CT appearance at multiple cuts (A – E) of a huge retroperitoneal mass with lipomatous and nonlipomatous components. The nonlipomatous component (arrow X, Panel D) contains calcific elements. Note the posterior extension of the lipomatous component (arrow Y, Panel D), which extends superiorly (Panels A – C). The exact boundaries of this component are difficult to appreciate on CT. While neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation comprise a frequent approach for retroperitoneal sarcomas at our institution, the extent of the tumor made this approach unfeasible. Resection was therefore planned unless an intraoperative biopsy revealed lymphoma. Resection was accomplished through a T-type incision (Figure 2), and entailed removal of the right kidney, terminal ileum, ascending colon, sigmoid colon and the left spermatic cord structures, all of which were intimately attached to the mass. Encasement of the external iliac artery and vein was also encountered near the end of the procedure. This was not fully appreciated preoperatively, as that component of the tumor was so much less conspicuous on CT than the rest of the tumor, given its fatty consistency (Figure 1E). The mass was split in half to facilitate dissection from the iliac vessels. An anastomosis was constructed from descending colon to rectum. A transverse colon mucous fistula and an ileostomy were brought out, as the ileum was dusky at the end of the procedure. Operative exposure of the tumor through a T-type abdominal incision. The tumor was submitted for histological examination in two parts measuring, 30.0 × 10.0 × 6.5 cm and 32.0 × 20.0 × 10.0 cm, weighing 19.8 kg in total (Figure 3). On gross examination the mass was variegated, with fleshy and solid cystic degeneration containing areas of osseous consistency. Microscopic examination revealed a juxtaposition of well differentiated liposarcoma and a spindle cell sarcoma with heterologous chondrosarcomatous elements consistent with a dedifferentiated liposarcoma (Figure 4). En bloc resection specimen of heterogeneous tumor with attached organs. Note the lipomatous regions (A), the calcified areas (B), and the remaining nonlipomatous component (C). Histologic appearance of various elements of the tumor as sampled in different regions. A. Well differentiated liposarcoma. B. Low grade spindle cell component. C. Cellular spindle cell component. D. Chondrosarcomatous component. The patient was discharged from hospital on the seventh postoperative day. He was followed in the surgical oncology outpatient clinic monthly. Four months after resection the patient had a follow-up CT scan, which demonstrated an intra-abdominal recurrence consisting almost completely of a calcified, nonlipomatous tumor (Figure 5). The patient died one month later. CT appearance at multiple cuts (A – D) of the recurrent tumor. The recurrence was more homogeneous than the primary tumor, consisting almost completely of the calcific component of the nonlipomatous portion of the tumor. Discussion The patient in our case manifested the dedifferentiated variant of liposarcoma. The term \"dedifferentiated liposarcoma\" refers to the development of a high grade nonlipogenic sarcoma juxtaposed to a well differentiated liposarcoma. The majority (80 – 90%) occur primarily de novo, although secondary dedifferentiation can occur with multiple recurrences of a well differentiated liposarcoma. CT and Magnetic resonance imaging scans typically reveal well defined nonlipomatous masses associated with fatty tumor; the transition between the two components is characteristically abrupt, although blended transitions are seen in about 20% of cases. Calcifications appear in about 30% and usually correspond to osseus metaplasia, although they may represent osteosarcomatous or chondrosarcomatous elements. The most frequent phenotype of dedifferentiation is that of a high grade pleomorphic malignant fibrous histiocytoma-like sarcoma. Other phenotypes observed include leiomyosarcomatous, rhabdomyosarcomatous, osteosarcomatous and angiosarcomatous elements, as well as other nonlipogenic elements. A further distinctive pattern in some cases is the presence of micronodular spindle cell whorls, often associated with ossification. Among liposarcomas, the presence of features of the dedifferentiated variant strongly portends a worse prognosis. The overall 5-year survival of dedifferentiated liposarcomas is 20%; the 5-year survival of well differentiated liposarcomas is 83%. Dedifferentiated liposarcomas recur locally in 40 – 83% and distant metastases appear in 15 – 30%. Therefore, histomorphologic features impact outcomes related to retroperitoneal liposarcomas. While generally the phenotype of the nonlipogenic component does not impact prognosis of dedifferentiated liposarcomas, the presence of calcifications has been identified as an adverse prognostic factor. In the present situation, it is obvious that the biologically most aggressive component consisted of the calcified (chondrosarcomatous) component. That is, the recurrence was less heterogeneous than the primary tumor, as it had widespread and dense calcifications, but no obvious lipomatous elements. Complete resection of the tumor is perhaps the most important factor determining long-term survival. Unfortunately, the rate of complete respectability is only about 53%. As illustrated in the present case, in addition to the limitations imposed by the retroperitoneal anatomy, another obstacle to successfully obtaining margins is the difficulty in distinguishing normal retroperitoneal fat from the lipogenic component of the tumor. This was illustrated by the underestimation of the extent of the tumor around the iliac vessels. Moreover, the intraoperative decision to remove the kidney was made in view of the difficulty in distinguishing normal perinephric fat and neoplastic fat; kidney was not involved with tumor, once examined microscopically. Indeed, in a series of retroperitoneal liposarcomas from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, nephrectomy was performed in 38% of patients, although the number in which kidney was actually involved on pathology was not reported. Thus, anatomical constraints and difficulty distinguishing more differentiated fatty tumor from normal fat limit the surgeon\\'s ability to confidently and completely remove all neoplastic elements. Conclusions Dedifferentiated liposarcomas represent aggressive variants of liposarcomas. Each morphological element of these heterogeneous tumors may manifest completely different biology. The overall biological behavior of dedifferentiated liposarcomas is likely dictated by the most aggressive element, which typically resides in the nonlipomatous portion of the tumor.

       "       'Adenoid cystic carcinoma of the parotid metastasizing to liver: case report Background Adenoid cystic carcinoma is a rare malignant parotid tumor. Metastasis can occur even a decade or more after initial treatment of the primary. Case presentation We report a 60 year old female patient who presented with adenoid cystic carcinoma of the parotid gland. She underwent a total conservative parotidectomy followed by adjuvant radiotherapy. While on follow up, patient developed multiple liver metastases which manifested three years later. Patient lived for another two years before she died of her disease. Conclusions Although distant metastases of adenoid cystic carcinoma develop frequently, isolated metastasis to liver is unusual. Even after manifestation of distant metastasis, patients can be expected to live for a number of years. Palliative chemotherapy can be considered in symptomatic cases while the usefulness of metastatectomy is controversial. Background Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is a rare malignant neoplasm of the salivary gland. Salivary gland neoplasms constitute 3% of cancers of all sites, of which, 10–15% are malignant. Though ACC is the most common malignant tumor of the submandibular, sublingual and minor salivary glands, it accounts for only 15% of parotid cancers. They are generally slow growing and spread relentlessly to adjacent structures. Hematogenous spread is more common than lymphatic spread, the common sites of metastasis being the lung, bone and viscera. We present a case of multiple liver metastases occurring 3 years after surgery for ACC of the parotid gland. The primary therapy, metastasis and outcome of ACC are discussed. Case presentation A 60 year old woman presented with a small swelling beneath the right ear lobe of 4 months duration. The swelling measured 2 × 1 cm placed in the superficial part of the parotid and was not fixed. There was no facial nerve palsy or palpable cervical nodes. A fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) was carried out which showed the lesion to be ACC. The clinical staging was T1, N0, M0. The patient underwent a total conservative parotidectomy after metastatic work up. Histopathology revealed ACC with cribriform pattern and perineural invasion (Figure 1). 60 Gy adjuvant external beam radiotherapy was administered post-operatively to the parotid area and the neck. Patient was placed on regular follow-up. Three years after primary surgery, patient presented with heaviness and pain in the right hypochondrium of 15 days duration. Patient was anicteric and abdominal examination revealed firm nodular and non tender enlargement of the liver. There was no ascites. Surgical site and neck were clinically normal. Chest roentgenogram was normal. Ultrasonography (US) of the abdomen revealed multiple metastatic lesions scattered in both lobes (Figure 2). Liver function tests were normal and an US guided FNAC revealed metastatic ACC (Figure 3). Since the lesions were multiple and scattered over both lobes of liver, surgical option was not considered and the patient was offered palliative chemotherapy which she declined. She developed pedal edema and abdominal distention 20 months after detection of liver metastasis. On clinical examination, patient was anicteric but liver had increased in size and abdomen showed evidence of a little free fluid. Chest CT scan was normal. Bone scan did not suggest any metastatic focus. Patient died a month later still without evidence of local recurrence or pulmonary metastasis. Conclusions Although ACC is the second most common malignant salivary gland neoplasm and constitutes approximately one third of all salivary gland malignancies it constitutes only 2% of parotid neoplasms. As ACC is neurotropic, frozen section analysis of nerve margins is suggested specially when nerve is grossly involved by the tumor. A total conservative or a radical parotidectomy is advocated for ACC though the main intent is to obtain a tumor free area of at least 1 cm. ACC, with its often unusually slow biologic growth, tends to have a protracted course and ultimately a poor outcome, with a 10-year survival reported to be less than 50% for all grades. These carcinomas typically show frequent recurrences and late distant metastases. In a retrospective review of 92 cases, a tumor size greater than 4 cm was associated with an unfavorable clinical course. Cribriform and solid patterns seen histologically were thought to predict more biological aggressiveness while tubular pattern represented more differentiated pattern of ACC. Over long periods of patient follow-up such grade based prognostication is less valid. Currently, stage and tumor location are the only factors considered prognostically significant. Radiotherapy has been used as a primary modality for patients with surgical contraindications and in those with unresectable neoplasms. Though no improvement in survival is reported, the use of adjuvant radiation improves locoregional control and disease free survival. This patient received adjuvant radiation and did not have any locoregional recurrence. Regional metastasis is less common occurring in about 17% while systemic failure occurs in 33 to 50% of the patients. Though involvement with distant metastases are unpredictable, organs involved in the order of decreasing frequency are lung, bone, brain and the liver. Other rare metastatic sites of parotid and non parotid ACC include stomach, toe, choroids, brain and skin. The initial site of metastasis is usually the organ containing the first capillary bed (first filter) and hence lungs would be the common site of metastasis. Clinical observations from various malignancies have indicated that metastasis from certain types of tumor tend to occur in specific target organs leading to the famous \\'soil and seed\\' hypothesis where metastatic cells \\'home\\' to the organ. Though liver metastasis has been reported, most of the liver metastases reported are of non parotid ACC. The occurrence is usually metachronous or synchronous with metastasis to other organs like the lung as it is the first filter. In the series of Spiro, of the 74 patients developing metastasis from salivary gland ACC, 23 did so without loco-regional recurrence while 5 had isolated bone metastasis. Sung and colleagues found metastases in 46 out of 94 head and neck ACC. In that study, only one patient developed liver metastasis and that patient had metastasis to both lung and bone. In this case, the patient manifested with multiple metastatic foci in the liver as the first and only metastatic organ which is very unusual. Surgical options of metastatectomy were not explored as patient had multiple metastases involving both lobes of liver. Although the patient lived with disease for a further two years, she did not show any evidence of lung metastasis or loco-regional recurrence. In this patient, the liver metastasis could have occurred prior to treatment as an organ of preference; evidenced by the fact that there were no other organs showing metastasis nor was there a loco-regional recurrence later. Studies in ACC have shown long tumor doubling times of pulmonary metastasis and late recurrences up to 10 years after primary treatment. The estimated doubling time of lung metastasis in ACC ranges from 200 to 600 days. There is even a suggestion that metastasis at the cellular level could occur many years prior to clinical presentation of primary tumor. FNAC was done to prove the metastatic foci in this patient and can be a useful tool for diagnosis. Although this patient declined chemotherapy, chemotherapeutic responses have been reported in ACC. ACC carries a mortality of 75–80% over a 30 year period and most patients who die of their disease do so between 5 and 10 years after initial treatment. Our patient died 5 years from diagnosis with metastatic disease that developed 3 years after initial treatment. ACC is a rare malignant tumor of parotid gland. Metastasis can manifest very late and hence a long term follow-up and a high index of suspicion is necessary to diagnose them early. An annual ultrasound study of abdomen would be desirable on follow-up. Unlike metastasis from other malignancies, these grow indolently and long term survival can be expected even with multiple metastases as also evidenced in the present case. Chemotherapy could be considered in selected patients as a therapeutic option in metastatic disease.

       "       'Successful Undergoing Esophagogastric Anastomosis with Right Gastroepiploic Vessels Congenital Absence: A Case Report Abstract A 60-year-old male farmer was admitted to the hospital with dysphagia for 2 months, and minimally invasive McKeown esophagectomy with lymphadenectomy was initially planned. However, congenital absence of the right gastroepiploic vessels (RGEVs) was blocked surgical procedure. Fortunately, we successfully performed esophagectomy and unconventional gastric remnant reconstruction without RGEVs, and intraoperative cervical venous superdrainage. Introduction Esophageal cancer (ESCC) is one of the most common upper gastrointestinal malignancies in the world. Currently, the standard paradigm for treating ESCC is a comprehensive treatment, mainly based on surgery. Clinically, the stomach is the preferred organ for digestive reconstruction after esophageal resection, and the blood supply to the gastric conduit is a crucial factor in determining the success of the reconstruction. During surgery, it is particularly important to explore and protect the right gastroepiploic artery (RGEA), which is the main source of blood in the reconstructed stomach. Although congenital absence of the right gastroepiploic vessels (RGEVs) is relatively rare, we encountered this case. In this case, we successfully performed esophagectomy and unconventional gastric remnant reconstruction without RGEVs, and intraoperative cervical venous superdrainage. Case Report A 60-year-old male farmer was admitted to the hospital due to 2 months of dysphagia with no history of abdominal trauma or surgery was admitted to the hospital for 2 months. Endoscopy revealed a neoplasm at 28–33 cm from the incisors, and biopsy confirmed squamous cell carcinoma. Further, whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) scans indicated that the uneven thickening of the middle and lower esophagus was FDG-avid, and no extraesophageal invasion was present. Therefore, the tumor was clinically staged as cT3NxM0, and minimally invasive McKeown esophagectomy with lymphadenectomy was initially planned. Congenital absence of the right gastroepiploic vessels (RGEVs). ☆Greater curvature of stomach, ☆Lesser curvature of stomach. Microvascular anastomosis of the short gastric vein to the left anterior cervical vein to superdrainage. Thoracic surgery was first started with thoracoscopy through the right chest, esophageal mobilization, and mediastinal lymph node dissection, which proceeded smoothly. Subsequently, the abdominal surgery was performed laparoscopically in the supine position. Unexpectedly, RGEVs were not found in the greater curvature of the stomach near the pylorus, suggesting congenital absence of RGEVs (Figure 1). After thorough exploration by laparoscopy, during which the right gastric artery was a major conduit supplying blood to the stomach, we decided to perform an open operation for whole-gastric reconstruction. The stomach was fully mobilized by dividing the left gastric artery, the short gastric arteries, and the posterior gastric artery. Subsequently, the blood supply to the gastric remnant was observed for 30 min, and only the right gastric artery was preserved. Intriguingly, because there was no ischemia of the gastric mucosa, a manual gastroesophageal anastomosis was performed via the retrosternal route to the left neck. Furthermore, microvascular anastomosis of the short gastric vein to the left anterior cervical vein was performed for superdrainage (Figure 2). Finally, jejunostomy was performed to provide nutritional support.   Postoperatively, to prevent thrombosis, anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin was started, and other routine measures such as gastrointestinal decompression, nutritional support, and infection prevention were implemented. On postoperative day 7, upper gastrointestinal radiography did not reveal any anastomotic fistula or esophageal stenosis. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 10 without complications. Histopathological examination revealed esophageal squamous carcinoma staged as pT3N2M0, and no signs of discomfort or recurrence were reported at 1-year follow-up. Discussion During surgery for esophageal cancer, RGEA is used as the main blood supply vessel for the gastric conduit, and intraoperative exploration and protection are particularly important. To date, the epidemiology of RGEVs absence and intraoperative injury has been unclear. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of congenital absence of RGEVs. As is known to us all, RGEA rarely varies in its origin, mainly comes from the gastroduodenal artery, and occasionally aberrantly originates from the superior mesenteric artery. In one study of 28 cadaver dissections by Jiang et al, RGEA was found to be present in all cases, whereas the left gastroepiploic artery was absent in two cases. In other studies of 17 specimens from Japan and 100 specimens from France, RGEA was present in all the cases. In this case, the patient did not find a RGEA during intraoperative exploration and had no previous history of abdominal surgery, suggesting a congenital absence, resulting in the inability to perform the planned operation. In such cases, the congenital absence of the RGEA was considered to contribute to the development of other main gastric arteries, which appeared to be larger. Therefore, we successfully performed whole-gastric reconstruction, in which the blood supply was the right gastric artery alone, and microvascular anastomosis of the short gastric vein to the left anterior cervical vein. While congenital absence of RGEA has not been reported, there are some reports of successful esophagogastrostomy in patients with acquired absence of RGEA. Chen et al reported a case of ESCC with acquired absence of RGEA, which was attributed to a history of right hemicolectomy using an unconventional whole gastric conduit to complete cervical reconstruction. Postoperative angiography suggested that the right gastric artery was the only source of blood supply to the gastric conduit. Charalampous et al reported a patient with ESCC without RGEA due to a duodenal bleeding ulcer treated with gastroduodenal artery ligation 10 years ago who underwent transthoracic esophagectomy using a gastric conduit to restore gastrointestinal continuity. Neither of the two cases experienced postoperative complications, such as anastomotic leakage. Hence, it is feasible to supply the gastric replacement esophagus with the right gastric artery in the absence of RGEA. Blood supply to the gastric conduit could be a major risk factor for complications associated with esophageal cancer treatment. Additionally, some of the reasons for anastomotic leakage are a deficient arterial blood supply and insufficient venous outflow. Uchiyama et al proposed techniques, such as arterial supercharge or venous superdrainage. After superdrainage, the color of the gastric reconstruction is usually restored, and the arterial stump pulsation is strong enough that the supercharge is no longer necessary. Therefore, in the absence of RGEA, it is particularly important to assess whether supercharge or superdrainage should be performed. In this case, the short gastric artery stump pulsated well. We considered supercharge in the neck unnecessary and performed microvascular anastomosis of the short gastric vein to the left anterior cervical vein to the superdrainage. Interestingly, Fujii et al performed esophagectomy and gastric remnant reconstruction with preoperative selective arterial embolization and intraoperative supercharge in a patient with an occluded RGEA. Thus, microvascular anastomosis to the supercharge or superdrainage can reduce the incidence of gastroesophageal anastomotic complications. Further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis. Conclusion To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of congenital absence of the right gastroepiploic vessels. Fortunately, we successfully performed esophagectomy and unconventional gastric remnant reconstruction without RGEVs, and intraoperative cervical venous superdrainage.

       "       \"A case of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure secondary to late onset nemaline rod myopathy: A multi-disciplinary approach Background Nemaline rod myopathy (NRM) is a rare muscle disorder defined by muscle weakness, respiratory insufficiency, and dysphagia. Respiratory muscle involvement can lead to acute hypercapnic respiratory failure, posing significant challenges in management. Case presentation Our patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of polymyositis, who presented with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure secondary to a suspected polymyositis flare. Despite initial management, the patient experienced complications, including dysphagia, thrombocytopenia, and altered mental status. Neurological consultations revealed conflicting opinions regarding the primary diagnosis, suggesting inclusion body myositis. The patient's condition continued to deteriorate, prompting discussions about prognosis and palliative care options. This case highlights the challenges in managing respiratory failure in patients with late-onset nemaline myopathy and the importance of multidisciplinary care in addressing complex medical needs. Conclusion This case emphasises the complexity of managing respiratory failure in patients with late-onset nemaline myopathy and the significance of adopting a multidisciplinary approach. Timely interventions, including respiratory support, dysphagia management, and palliative care discussions, are vital in optimizing patient care and quality of life. Further research is warranted to elucidate optimal management strategies and improve outcomes in this patient population. Introduction Nemaline rod myopathy (NRM) is a rare muscle disorder defined by the presence of eosinophilic rod-shaped inclusions or nemaline bodies in muscle fibers. It is classified into various subtypes based on age of disease onset and severity of muscle weakness. This disorder is mostly congenital resulting from genetic mutations and they present with muscle weakness and hypotonia. It may follow an autosomal dominant or recessive inheritance pattern. In adults, nemaline myopathy can be either hereditary, symptomatic in adulthood or present in adulthood without a hereditary pattern. The case under discussion is of an adult-onset form also known as late onset nemaline rod myopathy. Case presentation Our patient is a 73-year-old male with a past medical history of polymyositis, hypertension, constipation, and insomnia, who presented to the emergency department with dyspnea. He had been experiencing weakness and changes in mental status since his last intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment. Initial assessment revealed hypothermia, bradycardia, and hypoxia, prompting admission for acute hypercapnic respiratory failure secondary to a possible polymyositis flare. Upon admission, he received supportive care including fluid resuscitation, oxygen therapy, and antibiotic coverage. Patient was started on corticosteroids, bronchodilators, and bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) for respiratory support. Investigations were undertaken to identify the cause of his respiratory distress, including blood cultures, urine analysis, and imaging studies, which were largely unremarkable. His clinical condition improved temporarily, but not soon after, he developed altered mental status owing to hypercapnia. An arterial blood gas analysis revealed respiratory acidosis with a compensatory increase in bicarbonate levels. A comprehensive plan was devised for continued management, including transitioning to home non-invasive ventilation (NIV). Shortly thereafter, he developed shingles and further complications arose, such as dysphagia confirmed on modified barium swallow study, thrombocytopenia, and debility requiring full assistance for activities of daily living. Consultations with neurology and rheumatology raised questions about the primary diagnosis of polymyositis, with a strong clinical suspicion for inclusion body myositis. In addition, the pattern of weakness and atrophy was more suggestive of inclusion body myositis than polymyositis. Further discussions with the patient's previous neurologist shed light on his extensive medical history, muscle biopsy report and IVIg therapy. Despite initial stabilization, his respiratory status deteriorated, necessitating transfer to the intensive care unit for closer monitoring and adjustment of his respiratory support. He tolerated BiPAP well during his ICU stay. Throughout his hospitalization, efforts were made to address his thrombocytopenia, constipation, and dysphagia. Oncology consultation was sought for further evaluation of his thrombocytopenia, while palliative care discussions were initiated given the complexity of his medical condition and declining respiratory status. Possible intubation, tracheostomy, and code status were elaborately discussed with the patient and family, following which the patient expressed a preference for a DNR/DNI order. Despite challenges with BiPAP adherence, patient showed improvement with consistent use of the device, leading to discussions on discharge planning. Physical therapy recommended a transfer to a subacute rehabilitation facility, but the patient wished to be discharged home. Arrangements were made for home health services, including physical therapy, and visiting nurse support. Prior to discharge, the patient's medication regimen was adjusted. Dietary modifications were recommended to address his dysphagia, and precautions were advised to prevent aspiration. Also, a tyrosine rich diet was recommended, which has been proven beneficial in patients with nemaline myopathy. Patient's discharge plan emphasized the importance of continued respiratory support with BiPAP, along with close follow-up with his primary care provider and neurologist. Home equipment, including cough assistance and suction devices, were provided to aid in airway clearance and ensure a safe transition to home care. Discussion Nemaline myopathy is named after the characteristic fine, thread-like rod bodies observed on muscle biopsy. The prefix “nema-” is derived from Greek and means “thread-like.” Nemaline myopathy is most commonly caused by mutations in the nebulin (NEB) gene and skeletal muscle alpha-actin (ACTA1) gene. Nemaline myopathy is a rare genetic muscle disorder with a wide range of severity and variable presentation. The spectrum of clinical phenotypes of nemaline myopathy is wide, even in individuals with mutations in the same gene. Congenital myopathies typically manifest with slowly progressive or stable clinical courses. Early signs include hypotonia (“floppy infant syndrome”), muscle weakness, hypotrophia, and delayed motor milestones. Some patients exhibit a myopathic face, ptosis and pronounced facial weakness, and may even need a feeding tube, especially in neonates. Facial and skeletal deformities are common. Sporadic late-onset nemaline myopathy (SLONM) is a rare, subacute adult-onset non-hereditary myopathy. The earliest reported case dates back to 1966. SLONM most often presents with bilateral proximal muscle weakness and atrophy. Of note, the creatine kinase level is usually normal or mildly elevated. The severity of the disease determines the clinical course. Respiratory involvement is associated with an unfavourable prognosis. SLONM may be seen in conjunction with HIV (SLONM-HIV); J Maytal et al. reported a case of progressive nemaline myopathy in a patient coinfected with HIV-1 and HTLV-2. The diagnosis of nemaline myopathies involves a multidisciplinary approach with careful clinical, pathological and genetic correlations. Recent advances in genetic testing for the diagnosis of nemaline myopathy employs a next generation sequencing targeted gene panel. Although invasive, histopathological and ultrastructural studies of muscle biopsy specimens may still prove valuable. Also, muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become a significant tool for diagnosing and revealing specific patterns of muscle involvement. Rod bodies, the pathologic hallmark of nemaline rod myopathy are best visualized on modified Gomori trichrome staining as dark red/purple structures against a blue-green myofibrillar background. It is interesting to note that, a study conducted by E Malfatti et al. demonstrated that the amount of nemaline bodies appears to be inversely correlated with clinical severity. These peculiar inclusions are derived from Z-discs and have a similar composition. Supportive care, including physical therapy, respiratory physiotherapy and nutritional support are essential in managing nemaline myopathy. Although no specific drug targets nemaline myopathy, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy and immunosuppressive agents may be considered for their anti-inflammatory effects in select cases. However, evidence supporting their efficacy in the management of nemaline myopathy is limited. The approach to therapy is tailored to the patient's symptoms. Management of nemaline myopathy necessitates a multidisciplinary approach. Cases of late-onset nemaline myopathy presenting with respiratory failure, which align closely with the clinical patterns and course of our patient have previously been reported. Isolated muscular weakness without signs of upper or lower motor neuron involvement, raises clinical suspicion for myopathy. Further assessment of relevant risk factors and extramuscular symptoms is mandated to determine the type of myopathy. Respiratory failure in nemaline myopathy can occur due to weakness and dysfunction of the respiratory muscles, such as the diaphragm and intercostal muscles. Muscle weakness can impair ventilation, causing hypercapnia and consequent hypoxemia. As disease advances, individuals may require ventilatory support, such as non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or mechanical ventilation to assist with breathing. Regular monitoring of oxygen levels and respiratory function is crucial in identifying signs of respiratory compromise early. Management involves adopting a multidisciplinary approach, including respiratory therapy, physical therapy, and in severe cases, long-term ventilatory support may be required.

       "       'A Case of Superficial Kaposiform Hemangioendothelioma Treated with Oral Propranolol Combined with Topical Sirolimus Abstract Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma(KHE) without Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon is a rare tumor primarily observed in pediatric patients; however, its documentation in the literature remains limited. We reported about a 1-year-old boy diagnosed with superficial KHE who received oral propranolol in combination with topical sirolimus and reviewed relevant reports and treatment of superficial KHE. Introduction Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma (KHE) is a rare tumour primarily found in pediatric patients and exhibits borderline malignant characteristics with rarely spontaneous resolution. Existing reports on superficial KHE are limited, and there is no established standard treatment. In this study, we report about a case involving a pediatric patient who underwent oral propranolol and topical sirolimus therapy for the management of KHE. Case Presentation (a) Prior to treatment. (b) The plaques were lighter in color after one year of treatment. (a) B-ultrasound examination showed hyperechoic area with vascular echo. (b) Follow-up B-ultrasound showed scattered hyperechoic areas with a little blood flow signals. (a) Histopathological showing focal, well-circumscribed nodules comprised of atypical spindle cells (HE, ×50). (b) The spindle-shaped endothelial cells aligned to form a slit-like vascular channels (arrow, HE, ×100). (c) The proliferated vessels were positive for CD31(CD31, ×50). (d) The proliferated vessels were positive for CD34(CD34, ×50). (e) The proliferated vessels were negative for GLUT-1 (GLUT-1, ×50). (f) D2-40 staining was negative in the center of the lesion and positive in the surrounding dilated lymphatic vessels (D2-40, ×50). The patient was a 1-year-old boy. At 2 months of age, red plaques appeared on the left mandible and prothorax. Physical examination revealed firm, red plaques, and elevated cutaneous temperature with no pain (Figure 1a). His family history was unremarkable. Laboratory investigations found no obvious abnormalities in routine blood and coagulation tests, and there was no evidence of the Kasabach–Merritt phenomenon (KMP). B-ultrasonography showed a patchy hyperechoic area in the chest wall, approximately 0.6 cm thick, with unclear boundaries abundant blood flow signals, and vascular echoes. The diameter of the thicker blood vessels was approximately 0.16cm (Figure 2a). MRI indicated a thickening of the anterior chest wall epidermis, a slightly longer T2 signal on the fat suppression sequence consistent with T1, and a slightly longer T2 signal cloud shadow in the subcutaneous tissue of the left anterior margin of the mandible. Histological examination of a biopsy sample from the plaques identified blood vessels in a tufted or plexiform distribution, CD31(+), CD34(+), D2-40(-), and GLUT-1(-) (Figure 3). The diagnosis was confirmed as superficial KHE.    Considering the patient’s young age and the less aggressive nature of the tumor, we suggested administering oral propranolol at a daily dose of 2mg/kg and applying topical sirolimus 0.1% gel twice daily. The patient had no significant adverse reactions during the treatment period. One year later, there was a noticeable lightening of lesion color, resolution of the induration, and a decrease in cutaneous temperature (Figure 1b). Follow-up B-ultrasound revealed a reduction in thickness to approximately 0.21 cm with minimal blood flow signals (Figure 2b). Reexamination of MRI showed that the abnormal signal was reduced. Discussion KHE tumors are most commonly found in the extremities, trunk, and head/neck. They typically manifest as infiltrative soft tissue masses that invade the skin, adjacent muscles, and bones. Severe cases may involve coagulopathy, known as KMP, which significantly contributes to increased mortality. Presently, KHE is often reported with KMP, while cases of superficial KHE, limited to the skin without KMP, are rarely documented. Only five reports, comprising a total of 34 patients, who were predominantly male children, indicated occurrences on the limbs, face and neck, shoulder, and back. Liu et al reported positive responses to topical sirolimus 0.1% gel applied twice daily in 15 patients with superficial KHE, aged 4.6 months (0.2–36 months), over a treatment duration of 6–23 months. Sirolimus, an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), acts on the mTOR/PI3K/AKT pathway and decreases VEGF production, which can effectively inhibit vascular endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis. It is currently the most commonly used systemic therapy for KHE, demonstrating a high response rate and long-term effectiveness. For superficial KHE, the use of topical sirolimus is preferable, minimizing the potential infection risk of associated with oral administration. Propranolol is a non-selective β-adrenergic receptor blocker, but its mechanism in treating KHE remains unclear. Studies have shown that propranolol decreased VEGF and NO levels through downregulating the PI3K/AKT/eNOS/VEGF pathway, leading to growth arrest. Long-term effects induce endothelial cell apoptosis, leading to tumor regression. Wei et al reported successful outcomes with oral administration of propranolol at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day in 11 patients aged 3 months (1–27months) over a treatment duration of 6–50 months, demonstrating good long-term safety with no serious adverse reactions. Recently, a 2-month-old boy with superficial KHE showed a positive response to oral atenolol for 5 months. Topical tacrolimus has also been used to treat superficial KHE in seven patients, ranging from 2 weeks to 60-months-old, who were treated with tacrolimus alone for 18–30 months (mean 24 months) and this was combined with bandage for 6 months. No rebound effect was observed, and the mechanism of action may be related to tacrolimus’ inhibitory effect on T cell-derived cytokines and angiogenic factors. Conclusion In this case, the combination of oral propranolol and topical sirolimus may synergistically inhibit angiogenesis and may also regulate the immune response to effectively treat KHE. Despite the limitations of this case report, we demonstrate that oral propranolol and topical sirolimus are practical and effective treatments for KHE, with decreased risks of complications. In view of the safety, this treatment should be considered for low-risk patients with superficial KHE without KMP. Our findings need to be validated by clinical trials in the future.

       "['Echocardiographic assessment and percutaneous closure of multiple atrial septal defects Atrial septal defect closure is now routinely performed using a percutaneous approach under echocardiographic guidance. Centrally located, secundum defects are ideal for device closure but there is considerable morphological variation in size and location of the defects. A small proportion of atrial septal defects may have multiple fenestrations and these are often considered unsuitable for device closure. We report three cases of multiple atrial septal defects successfully closed with two Amplatzer septal occluders. Introduction Atrial septal defect (ASD) closure is now commonly performed using a transcatheter, percutaneous approach and with the Amplatzer septal occluder, large defects can be safely closed. Device deployment requires a rim of atrial septal tissue surrounding the defect to allow effective capture of the septum by the occluder. The rim of tissue is also important to separate the septal occluder from important structures including the inferior vena cava, coronary sinus and the atrioventricular valves. The majority of patients require a single device for closure of the ASD but a small proportion of patients may have more than one defect in the atrial septum. This can be difficult to diagnose using transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) as abnormal colour flow obscures the origins of the shunt, particularly if the second defect is situated inferiorly. We report three cases of patients referred for ASD closures that were found to have multiple ASDs and the techniques used to close these defects. Case 1 A 34-year old woman was referred for consideration of percutaneous ASD closure. The ASD had been diagnosed when the patient was 12 years old and TTE had suggested that the right ventricle was dilating. At cardiac catheterisation there were mildly elevated right ventricular systolic pressures and a pulmonary to systemic flow ratio of over two. The secundum ASD was estimated to be 15 mm wide using TTE with aneurysmal formation of the interatrial septum. The patient was admitted for percutaneous ASD closure and underwent uncomplicated placement of a 17 mm Amplatzer septal occluder. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) during the procedure revealed the presence of a second ASD near the inferior vena cava and a small post-procedure shunt. The septal occluder did not completely cover both defects. Equivalent chest x-ray radiation dose (assuming a single posteroanterior projection chest x-ray is eight centi-Gray/cm2) was 400. Repeat TTE continued to demonstrate left to right shunting and the patient was readmitted for a further device closure six months later. At cardiac catheterisation, the second defect was identified low in the secundum septum between the fossa ovalis and the mouth of the coronary sinus. The defect was successfully closed with a 9 mm Amplatzer septal occluder with no evidence of obstructed flow in either the coronary sinus or the inferior vena cava. Equivalent chest x-ray radiation dose for the second procedure was 187.',\n",
       " 'The patient remained well with no evidence of residual shunt six months following the procedure.

       " 'She was referred was further investigation and treatment. Cardiac catheterisation demonstrated a pulmonary to systemic flow shunt of four to one. Peri-procedure TEE revealed that there were two defects; one measuring 24 mm located inferiorly between the inferior vena cava and coronary sinus os with the second defect situated superiorly and measuring 30 mm.

       " 'Equivalent chest x-ray radiation dose was 403. The patient was discharged the following day and readmitted three months later for closure of the superior defect. This was performed using a 30 mm Amplatzer septal occluder. The procedure was technical difficult as after deployment of the left sided disc, the device initially lay obliquely in the defect. The final position was satisfactory with no evidence of intra-cardiac shunting (figure 1). There was no interference between the two devices and mitral valve function remained normal. Equivalent chest x-ray radiation dose for the second procedure was 727.',\n",
       " 'The patient remained well and at six month follow-up there was no evidence of residual shunt. Stored fluoroscopy following placement of the two Amplatzer septal occluders (ASOs). TEE – Transesophageal echocardiography probe. Case 3 A 30-year old woman was investigated for palpitations and a secundum ASD of approximately 20 mm was diagnosed. TEE suggested that the atrial septum was fenestrated with a small inferior rim of tissue and she was referred for device closure. At cardiac catheterisation it became clear that there were two principal defects, one in the fossa ovalis and the other situated inferior and posterior between the fossa ovalis and the coronary sinus. The superior hole was closed with a 16 mm Amplatzer septal occluder but failed to cover the inferior defect. A 15 mm Amplatzer septal occluder device was subsequently placed successfully across the inferior defect with a stable position (figure 2). Equivalent chest x-ray radiation dose for the procedure was 124. Subsequent follow-up revealed a small left to right shunt between the two septal occluders but further intervention was not considered necessary. Transesophageal echocardiography four-chamber image following deployment of the two Amplatzer septal occluders (ASO). LA – left atrium, LV – left ventricle, RA – right atrium, RV – right ventricle. Discussion There is considerable morphological variation of secundum-type ASDs. Podnar et al reported the echocardiographic findings of 190 patients with isolated secundum ASDs referred for device closure. Twenty four per cent had centrally placed defects but the remaining 144 patients had morphological variations. A deficient superior anterior rim was seen in 42%, a deficient inferior posterior rim in 10%, perforated aneurysm of the interatrial septum was seen in 7.9% and 7.3% of patients had multiple septal defects. Experience of multiple ASDs closure using more than one Amplatzer septal occluder remains limited. In the worldwide report of use of the Amplatzer septal occluder, 3460 patients received a single device but only 45 patients received two devices for multiple ASDs. Cao et al reported a series of 22 patients who had two septal occluders implanted simultaneously for multiple ASDs. Closure rate was 97.7% with one device embolisation. In closely positioned multiple defects the septal occluder should be implanted in the largest defect aiming to cover any smaller defects but in widely separated defects more than one device is required. Echocardiographic studies have suggested that patients with multiple ASDs should have a rim of tissue of more than seven millimetres between defects to allow the deployment of two septal occluders. Continuous echocardiographic monitoring is required for device positioning. When TEE is used, patients usually require a general anaesthetic due to the prolonged oesophageal intubation. The development of intracardiac echocardiography now provides an alternative to TEE for device closure. Benefits include more detailed imaging, a reduced need for general anaesthesia, and reduced radiation exposure. In particular, use of intracardiac echocardiography allows clearer visualisation of the inferior atrial septum. Three-dimensional echocardiography may allow more detailed assessment of multiple ASD anatomy and septal occluder positioning. One question that remains unclear is whether multiple septal occluders should be deployed simultaneously or implanted as staged procedures. Serious complications during single septal occluder implantation is a rare occurrence (less than 0.3% of cases) but it likely that simultaneous deployment will increase the procedure risk. When implanting large devices (greater than 20 mm) with little septal separation it is favourable to deploy the larger device and bring the patient back for a further procedure once the device has stabilised. Conclusions There is considerable variation in atrial septal defect anatomy. A small proportion of patients with an ASD have more than one defect and these can be closed using conventional septal occluders under transoesophageal echocardiography guidance. The use of intracardiac echocardiography should allow more accurate device positioning, particularly defects located low in the atrial septum.

Her hospital course consisted of observation in the ICU and blood pressure management. The case illustrates that intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) can sometimes present indolently and does not always require surgical intervention. Introduction Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) accounts for 15% of all strokes and 50% of stroke-related mortality, which equates to approximately 2.8 million deaths globally every year. In 2010, hemorrhagic strokes accounted for nearly a third of 33 million stroke cases and had a mortality rate of just over 50% worldwide. Two major risk factors for ICH are age and anticoagulant use. The overall increase in life expectancy means a larger aging population, which translates to an increased incidence of ICH. ICH is more prevalent in older persons, and older persons are also more likely to be on an anticoagulant agent. Other risk factors for ICH are being part of non-white ethnicity, being male, older age, and having familial apolipoprotein syndromes. Other risk factors also include cerebral amyloid angiopathy, uncontrolled or untreated hypertension, and drug abuse (i.e.'},\n",

       "  'chunk': 'A Case Report Examining a Contraindication for Mechanical Thrombectomy in the Setting of a Large Vessel Occlusion and a Concurrent Contralateral Intracranial Hemorrhage An acute ischemic stroke occurring contralateral to a hemorrhagic stroke is an uncommon occurrence that presents unique challenges. Hemorrhages have classically been described as a contraindication for mechanical thrombectomy. However, the natural course of a large vessel occlusion with or without decompressive hemicraniectomy is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This paper investigates the origin of the contraindication for mechanical thrombectomy, the natural history of large vessel occlusion, risks of craniectomy, and risks of mechanical thrombectomy. Given the likelihood of poor outcomes without intervention, mechanical thrombectomy could be considered in select individuals, but future studies into the natural course of contralateral ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes would better guide management. Introduction Strokes is the number one cause of adult disability and the fourth leading cause of death in the United States with costs in 2009 both direct and indirect totaling around $68.9 billion. Strokes impact approximately seven million individuals in the United States, about 3% of the adult population. However, not all strokes are created equal. Approximately 87% of strokes are ischemic with the remaining being hemorrhagic. Mortality rates associated with ischemic strokes are approximately 57.4%\\xa0with a subset of those with proximal vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation having a 60-80% mortality in 90 days or inability to regain functional independence. Acute ischemic stroke care has evolved over time with studies proving the benefits of acute intervention, such as intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular thrombectomy which can significantly improve a patient’s functional outcome. The following is a case that demonstrates the nuance in a broad guideline that merits further investigation.'},\n",

       "  'chunk': 'Computed tomography-negative symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage in a patient with cerebral small vessel disease Abstract Rationale: Computed tomography plays a key role in the initial evaluation of suspected acute stroke by ruling out the possibility of hemorrhage before thrombolysis. Recently, many reports have described cases of symptomatic microbleeds, and there may also have been a case of computed tomography- negative intracerebral hemorrhage. Patient concerns: A 70-year-old female patient who had a history of lacunar infarction and severe small vessel disease developed dysarthria. On brain non-contrast computed tomography there was no evidence of intracerebral hemorrhage. However, brain magnetic resonance imaging performed at 3\\u200ahours after the initial computed tomography showed cerebral hemorrhage. Diagnoses: The diagnosis was computed tomography-negative intracerebral hemorrhage. Interventions: The patient was treated with cilostazole 100\\u200amg twice a day with blood pressure management. Outcomes: The dysarthria was fully recovered within 5 days and the patient did not suffer recurrent stroke symptoms over the following 2 years. Lessons: In patients with underlying severe small vessel disease and microbleeds, there could be computed tomography-negative hemorrhage and susceptibility weighted magnetic resonance image could be needed. More attention is required before applying thrombolysis therapy because there is a possibility of cerebral hemorrhage in those patients. Introduction Stroke is an emergent disease which results in death and severe disability. However, in many cases it can be reversed by timely treatment such as intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular thrombectomy. Thus, prompt diagnosis and treatment are necessary to minimize stroke-induced disability, and brain imaging plays a major role in determining treatment strategy. Non-contrast brain computed tomography (NCCT) is commonly used to differentiate hemorrhage from ischemia because it takes a short time and has high sensitivity for detecting cerebral hemorrhage. Intravenous thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is first line treatment in ischemic stroke patients who present within 4.5\\u200ahours. However, hemorrhagic complications were found to develop in 21.3% of patients and symptomatic hemorrhage in 5.6%. Once hemorrhagic complications occur, neurologic symptom may deteriorate and patients may have poor outcomes. Thus, intravenous thrombolysis should only be undertaken after careful examination of early brain images for signs of potential hemorrhagic. The authors encountered a case of a patient with acute cerebral hemorrhage in whom early brain NCCT gave no evidence of bleeding but magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated hemorrhage. Ruling out cerebral hemorrhage by brain CT may be insufficient, especially in patients with a history of severe small vessel disease and lacunar infarction. We describe this case with emphasis on the need for caution in employing intravenous thrombolysis in such patients. Case report A 70-year-old woman visited the emergency room with dysarthria that had started 5\\u200ahours earlier. She had been diagnosed with hypertension 11 years previously and took regular medication. She had also been diagnosed with corona radiata infarction, severe white matter change and multiple microbleeds 8 months earlier and was taking 100\\u200amg of cilostazole twice a day (Fig. 1).'},\n",

Introduction Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is the term used to describe any bleeding that takes place inside the intracranial vault, which comprises the brain parenchyma and surrounding meningeal spaces. Epidural hemorrhage, subdural hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and intraparenchymal hemorrhage are the four main kinds of intracranial bleeding. It can be difficult to differentiate between ICH and an ischemic stroke in acute presentation. The symptoms of an ICH rather than an ischemic stroke include coma, headache, vomiting, seizures, neck stiffness, and high diastolic blood pressure (BP), but only neuroimaging can make a definitive diagnosis. Stroke patients must first improve their general physical condition and fundamental daily living skills before improving their hand movement and hand muscle strength for instrumental activities of daily living training\\xa0. Similar to ICH without an underlying lesion, there is typically little evidence to recommend surgically removing the hemorrhage. Reflex-inhibiting movement patterns by Bobath assure\\xa0that normal tone is maintained in the affected limb and the development of abnormal movement patterns is prevented. She also says that for complete rehabilitation, incorporating the affected upper limb into all everyday tasks is essential. Unfortunately, like with all motor remediation theories, empirical data supporting the use of this approach is still inconclusive. When a blood artery inside the brain or between the skull and brain bursts, it causes an intracranial hematoma. The brain tissue is compressed by blood accumulation (hematoma). Brain tissue is compressed by the hematoma, a blood clump. A cerebral hematoma is potentially life-threatening and frequently requires rapid treatment, but some head injuries, such as those that merely result in momentary loss of consciousness\\xa0may be minor. CT scans are extremely useful for diagnosing hematomas. Generally, clinicians assume that progressive loss of consciousness associated with a head injury can be attributed to bleeding in the skull. In this latter group, the majority of the study on the advantages of surgery has been conducted. To remove the blood, surgery is frequently but not always necessary for cerebral hematomas. In a decompressive craniectomy (DC), a section of the skull is cut away to provide space for enlarged brain tissue. Although it has been used for many years to manage patients with brain edema and/or intracranial hypertension, its current use in therapy is debatable. Patients with malignant middle cerebral artery stroke have higher survival rates after DC, but some of them still experience moderate-to-severe impairment. When treating individuals with diffuse traumatic brain damage, an early (neuroprotective) DC is not more effective than standard medical care. Stroke places a tremendous burden on health resources worldwide. The incidence of stroke is currently substantially greater in India than in Western industrialized nations. In stroke, only a few possible symptoms include headache, nausea, convulsions, and localized or generalized neurologic problems. Deep structures are more prone to experience hypertension-related ICH, and as BP increases, the risk of ICH increases as well. Other risk factors for ICH include heredity, alcohol use, and low total serum cholesterol levels. Due to stroke, the patient's\\xa0quality of life gets affected as it has a direct\\xa0impact on\\xa0health systems; serious disabilities and functional limitations lead to compromised quality of life. Case presentation Patient information The 45-year-old female patient came to the hospital with flaccidity of the right upper and lower limbs. Bed mobility was very challenging for her. There were no sensory issues or deformities. Previously, she was affected by strokes twice, for which she underwent medical and physiotherapy treatment in the early stages. She had been taking medicine for her hypertension for the past two years. Now, after two years, she was affected by the same condition and got admitted in July for further treatment. On investigation, the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\\xa0revealed an area of blood density attenuation with multiple air foci in the left gangliocapsular region. An intracranial hemorrhage was observed on a CT scan of the brain. In this case, she underwent a decompressive craniotomy. After 36 hours of monitoring in the intensive care unit (ICU), she was shifted to the surgery ward for further management. Clinical findings In terms of time, place, and people, the patient was orientated. The vital signs were as follows: temperature 95.5 °F, BP\\xa0130/79 mmHg, pulse 63 beats per minute, respiration rate 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 98%. On neurological assessment, the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scored 7 as severe. A score of 30 was also determined as severe by the NIHSS. According to the modified Rankin scale (mRS), the patient scored\\xa05. The affected right upper limb and right lower limb were supported with a pillow. Ryle’s tube was attached for feeding. The patient was on intermittent catheterization as the bowel and bladder functions were hampered. In Table 1, the results of the deep tendon reflexes are presented. Grading of deep tendon reflexes.

       "  'chunk': 'There was not much difference in initial hematoma volume on CT scan (28.6 mL for group A, and 25 mL for group B). Interestingly, three patients showed progression of hematoma without evidence of rebleeding from a clipped aneurysm. This is why we concluded that remaining hematoma itself is a major triggering factor for progression of cerebral swelling. Removal of hematoma in case 2 was relatively easier than case 1. Massive hematoma enabled simple suction procedure in operation. In contrast, it was impossible because of arachnoid adhesion and sticky hematoma in case 2. Brain retraction to remove hematoma and small vein coagulation for bleeding control would aggravate progression of secondary cerebral brain swelling on POD 2. According to Jickling et al., a delayed hemorrhagic transformation occurs after 18 to 24 hours of stroke onset for several weeks, and the mechanism contributes to the processes involved in delayed blood-brain-barrier (BBB) opening after stroke. Removal of the blood clot in the intrasylvian hematoma is very difficult. Unlike hypertensive ICH that results from small lenticulostriate arteries and forms the global hematoma capsule and homogeneous character, intrasylvian hematoma consists of blood clot, thick arachnid trabecular, fibrin, and brain debrides. It is impossible to remove by simple aspiration, and, sometimes, coagulation and removal with brain retraction may be necessary.'},\n",

       "  'chunk': 'observed an incidence of 8% infarcts in their cohort of 212 patients with SICH. Prabhakaran et al. detected a 22.9% prevalence of associated infarcts as evidenced by diffusion-weighted image (DWI) abnormalities in a cohort of 118 SICH patients. The majority of these infarcts, however, were small subcortical and subclinical. Large vessel occlusion causing malignant cerebral infarction has been rarely reported. We add a case of vermian hematoma with infarct to our earlier reported two cases of malignant infarction following evacuation of a supratentorial SICH. Several mechanisms have been postulated to explain the possible occurrence of an infarct following a spontaneous hematoma. The majority of such infarcts are small and subcortical, conforming to border-zone or single perforator territories. Few recent studies have observed subclinical DWI lesions in 15% of patients with acute intracerebral hematoma (ICH) attributable to cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Since both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke share common risk factors and certain common pathogenic mechanisms, it is possible that an ischemic stroke may simply be a co-occurrence in the presence of common risk factors. Hypotension due to attempted aggressive reduction of BP following a hypertensive bleed may precipitate an ischemic event. Surgery for evacuation of the hematoma may be associated with intraoperative hemodynamic instability, which can result in an ischemic event. Though unlikely, infarcts following craniotomy may also be attributable to iatrogenic compression of vascular structures during craniotomy or through the durotomy defects. Large hematomas with surrounding edema can theoretically directly compress the adjacent cerebral vessels causing ischemia. Infection with persistent fever, dehydration, and electrolytic imbalance can all result in a hypercoagulable state following a bleed and can result in ischemia. One another postulated mechanism for ischemia is the massive release of blood and blood breakdown products into the CSF and subsequent inflammatory changes in the smooth muscle of the large cerebral arteries. Cerebral vasospasm, due to the presence of concomitant intraventricular hemorrhage or after indirect vessel manipulation at the time of craniotomy, is another suspected mechanism for ischemia. After acute brain injury, autoregulation may be abolished such that cerebral blood flow is linearly related to cerebral perfusion pressure. Aggressive BP lowering beyond the lower limits of cerebral autoregulation might induce cerebral ischemia in chronic hypertensive ICH patients. Our patient did not undergo surgery and the infarct and hematoma were located in different compartments. He did develop features of early sepsis while under treatment for vermian hematoma. Sepsis with an associated hypercoagulable state may be the precipitating factor resulting in the infarct. Attempts have been made to predict the risk of developing concomitant infarcts in patients with SICH. Wang et al. observed that the presence of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), hydrocephalus, the volume of intracranial hematoma, and neurosurgical intervention were important predictors of infarction of which IVH had the most statistical significance. Similarly, Prabhakaran et al. observed that the factors independently associated with DWI abnormality were a prior ischemic stroke, lowering of mean arterial pressure by over 40%, and craniotomy for ICH evacuation. Our patient did have the evidence of fourth ventricular blood but did not satisfy most of the above criteria. The rarity of such complications makes it less likely to appear in our clinical diagnosis and we feel one should consider this scenario as well. The remote site hemorrhages which are often encountered after tumor or hematoma decompressive surgery are shown in Table 1. The varied cases of remote site bleed following tumor excision and decompression The exact etiopathogenesis of these large infarcts remains uncertain and the management of such large infarcts needs to be on similar lines as for any ischemic infarct. The outcome, however, is usually grave. Conclusion Stroke physicians need to be aware that SICH patients have a potential threat of developing large vessel occlusion with malignant cerebral infarcts, especially after surgical decompression. Although the exact pathogenesis is unknown, size of the clot, IVH, hydrocephalus, and aggressive reduction of BP appear to be predictive factors. Financial support and sponsorship Nil.'},\n",

       "  'chunk': 'Laboratory findings revealed no evidence of vasculitis, infections, and coagulation disorders. Transthoracic echocardiography showed rheumatic heart disease with severe aortic stenosis and decreased left ventricular diastolic function. The ischemia was classified as ICA occlusion due to cardioembolic stroke. Warfarin was initiated after 2\\u2009weeks. Three months later, she underwent elective aortic valve replacement and continued long-term warfarin therapy. She could self-care after a follow-up period of 6\\u2009months and had modified Rankin Scale of 2. Discussion and conclusions Nontraumatic SAH is mainly caused by aneurysm rupture, but not all cases have an aneurysmal origin. cSAH is a rare and heterogeneous entity, and is characterized by bleeding along the cortical convexity. The prevalence of cSAH is reported to be 5–18% of all spontaneous SAH. Diverse causes of cSAH have been described including CAA, reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS), posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, ICA stenosis or occlusion, cerebral venous thrombosis, drug misuse, vasculitis, vascular malformation, brain tumors and abscesses. cSAH may occur simultaneously with acute ischemic stroke, but this co-occurrence is particularly rare. There are various reasons for this association, such as ICA stenosis or occlusion, artery dissection, RCVS, CAA, and cardioembolism. However, the most common cause of cSAH with acute ischemic stroke is ICA stenosis or occlusion. Moreover, cSAH has been described to occur invariably on the side with acute ischemic stroke, and it is notably unusual for cSAH to occur on the opposite side of the infarct territory. To date, there have been few reports about infarction with contralateral cSAH caused by RCVS, ICA dissection, embolic stroke of undetermined source, and CAA. This paper presented two cases of acute ischemic stroke with contralateral cSAH due to ICA atherosclerotic occlusion and cardioembolic stroke, respectively. The pathophysiology of the association between acute ischemic stroke and cSAH is not fully understood. The current leading theory suggests that cSAH may occur in the setting of severe atherosclerotic stenosis or large artery occlusion, potentially by a mechanism similar to hemorrhage caused by moyamoya disease, the acute alteration in hemodynamics may lead to cSAH. Plaque rupture leads to further atherothrombotic narrowing, while acute hypertension results in the spontaneous rupture of fragile collateral vessels. Further, another theory suggests that emboli to marginally perfused vessels can cause necrosis and rupture. In case 1 in our study, ICA occlusion had an influence on the hemispheric cerebral blood flow of both the occluded and contralateral sides. We speculate that increased contralateral leptomeningeal flow towards the occluded side may have caused cSAH. The establishment of collateral circulation can lead to hemodynamic changes on the contralateral side and leptomeningeal anastomoses on the cerebral surface may have served as a link for this increase in cerebral blood flow. Moreover, occlusion on the ischemic side may have led to the dilatation of the contralateral vasculature as a compensatory mechanism. This dilatation beyond physiological limits increases vessel fragility, and finally causes the ruptures of small vessels. Regarding case 2, the hemodynamic changes due to occlusion of ICA may also have participated in the pathogenesis of cSAH. In addition, we considered that emboli from the heart may have clogged the ipsilateral vessels and caused infarction. Moreover, these emboli may have damaged already highly dilated contralateral vasculature in the arterial border zone, leading to cSAH. Nevertheless, the precise mechanism by which this occurs remains unclear. Generally, antithrombotic treatment is suggested for patients with infarction. However, the increased risk of cerebral hemorrhage or SAH due to antithrombotic therapy cannot be ignored. There is no consensus on the treatment for acute ischemic stroke co-occurring with cSAH. Few studies suggest that antithrombotic agents are safe for patients with this condition who have large artery stenosis or occlusion. Antiplatelet or anticoagulation drugs did not seem to influence the outcome in our two cases. Both patients had a good prognosis which is consistent with the literature. Our case reports suggest that contralateral cSAH can occur alongside acute ischemic stroke caused by atherosclerotic ICA occlusion and cardioembolic stroke. cSAH did not lead to poorer outcomes in our patients.'},\n",

       "  'chunk': \"CASE REPORT A 59-year-old female patient visited emergency room with right side subjective weakness spontaneously. She had a clinical history of hypertension and other past medical history was unremarkable. There was no history of head trauma. Initial systolic and diastolic blood pressure was 140 mmHg / 80 mmHg. Routine laboratory finding is non-specific. She complained that right side subjective weakness and mild sensory numbness. However, The National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was 0. Initial computed tomography angiography at one and half hours after symptom onset demonstrated subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) localized in the left frontal convexity and mild focal stenosis at both A2 segments. Also the Magnetic resonance diffusion-weighted images (DWI) revealed an acute infarction of anterior cerebral arterial territory (Fig. 1). We could not find any vascular lesion on computed tomographic angiography (CTA) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and treated with dual antiplatelet drugs (cilostazole [Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. tokyo, Japan] 50 mg bid/day plus aspirin [Bayer Pharma AG., Leverkusen, Germany] 100 mg) and hydration for 7 days. Other work up for evaluation of acute cerebral infarction was echocardiogram and holter monitoring. But there was no abnormal finding except a few APB on holter monitoring. The patient's neurological finding was improved on day 2. She has done well for a follow-up period and her Modified Rankin Scale was 0 at day 5. The follow-up evaluation was performed at out-patient clinic after 5 months. CTA shows that the SAH was washed out and encephalomalatic change in left ACA territory. MRI also reveals that no evidences of acute infarction in DWI and hemorrhagic transformation in susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) (Fig. 2). DISCUSSION Although the prevalence of non-traumatic convexal SAH is reported to be 7.5% of all spontaneous SAH patients, little has been conscious of concerning the incidence of CSAH accompanying with acute infarction among many different etiologies of CSAH. Cuvinciuc et al. demostrated the image protocol to cover the wide spectum of entities potentially responsible for CSAH that brain CTA with a paired channel at both arterial and venous phases and MR imaging including GRE T2 sequences, FLAIR, DWI, MRA 3D TOF, contrast-enhanced venogram, and pre- and postgadoliniumT1-weighted imaging. However, We evaluated the CTA and MR imaging cluding T2, DWI, SWI and 3D TOF MRA. these work-up tests were enough to distinguish the etiolgies of CSAH. CTA and MRA are useful to determine the vascular causes of CSAH such as vascular malformations, RCVS, vasulitides, high-grade stenosis, moyamoya disease, and septic aneurysms. In addition, MR imging is ascertainable diagnositic tools between dural and cortical CVT, and non-vascular causes such as, CAA, PRES, neoplasm, abscess and cavernoma. In this case, ACA territory infarction seemed to occur hemodynamically because of stenotic lesion on A2 segment and hypoperfusion on brain SPECT with Tc-99 m HMPAO. Nakajima et al. assumed that the accompanying an infarction and non traumatic CSAH might demonstrate that hemodynamic insufficiency because of arterial stenosis or occlusion get to the critical point. For instance, after an acute infarction due to occlusive disease by the embolic or hemodynamic mechanism, ensuing dynamic changes of intracranial perfusion pressure might bring about the CSAH. Also Cuvinciuc et al. explained that the main mechanism of CSAH because of chronic arterial occlusive diseases is considered to be the rupture of dilated vulnerable compensatory pial vessels. Antiplatelet treatment is suggested for patients who have suffered the infarction. A large randominzed controlled trial studied Clopidogrel and Aspirin in High-Risk Patients with Acute Nondisabling Cerebrovascular Events (CHANCE) was finished in china. The result revealed that antiplatelet double therapy with clopidogrel plus aspirin was better than aspirin alone for reducing the risk of recurrent stroke and not increase the risk of bleeding among patients with high risk transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor infarction Due to our patient's acute hemorrhage on the frontal convexity, we were concerned the hemorrhagic transformation and rebleeding because dual antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel plus aspirin) was associated with a significant trend to increase moderate bleeding. So we treated with cilostazol plus aspirin successfully. The patient's symptom was improved and there was no evidence of rebleeding on following studies. Tan et al. reported that cilostazol, alone or with aspirin, decrease recurrence of ischemic stroke significantly, poststroke intracranial hemorrhage, and extracranial bleeding in patients with a prior ischemic stroke as compared with other antiplatelet treatments. Cilostazol, a selective inhibitor of cyclic nucleotidephosphodiesterase 3, increases activated intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations and thus inhibits platelet aggregation.\"},\n",

The neurosurgical team went for craniotomy with tubular evacuation of the hematoma; consequently, the patient improved. There was also improvement seen in the mass effect on uncus as depicted in\\xa0Figure 1C. Discussion SICH coexisting with subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage is very rare with only one case reported till now. Based on our recent review of the literature, this would mark the second instance of such a case being documented. Rather there are case reports of SDH combined with SAH but without SICH in the literature. Moreover, this will be the first case report explaining the temporal lobe being the infrequent site for bleeding in SICH. Less common etiologies for SICH include:\\xa0hypertensive vasculopathy and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), AVM, cerebral venous thrombosis, hemorrhagic infarction, bleeding disorders, sickle cell disease, cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome, cerebral vasculitis, Moyamoya disease, mycotic intracranial aneurysm, central nervous system infection, and primary or metastatic tumor. Old age, hypertension, and the use of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy are the major risk factors for spontaneous ICH. Other risk factors include obesity, high alcohol intake, race, ethnicity, tobacco use, stimulant drug use, infections, and small vessel vascular disease. The proposed hypothesis of the presence of concomitant SICH, SAH, and SDH can be found in the literature. SDH and SAH may accompany SICH when there is bleeding through the cortical surface that expands into the subdural space. SICHs involving lobar regions and concomitant SDH have been linked to cerebral amyloid angiopathy. SAH caused by a ruptured cerebral aneurysm may extend into the subdural space and this occurs in approximately 0.5% up to 7.9% of cases. Rarely, aneurysm rupture results in discrete SDH without obvious SAH\\xa0. Rarely, a cortical surface rupture of an arteriovenous malformation, arteriovenous fistula, or cavernous malformation will present as an isolated acute SDH\\xa0. Stretching of the arachnoid layer, which is attached to the AVM can result in direct bleeding into the subdural region, which is exacerbated by brain movement. Similarly, blood from a pia-arachnoid rupture that is high flow could extravasate into the subdural area. Last but not least, SDH may also be brought on by a ruptured bridge artery, a cortical artery that runs between the cortex and the dura layer. To summarize, there are five mechanisms listed in the literature that can cause SDH combined with SICH and SAH: (I) adhesion of the aneurysm to the arachnoid membrane because of minor successive hemorrhages; (II) extension and then erosion of the aneurysm in the cavernous sinus; (III) laceration of the arachnoid membrane because of high-pressure hemorrhage; (IV) an ICH that tears the brain tissues and possibility of an aneurysm in the subdural carotid artery directly resulting in a hematoma  Patients who have severe brain atrophy are more likely to develop SDH due to rupture of the bridging veins between the brain's dural membrane and cortical surface. A history of chronic alcohol misuse, being older, and having experienced a traumatic brain injury are all risk factors for developing cerebral atrophy. In those patients, insignificant head trauma or even a pure whiplash injury without a physical impact may result in an SDH. Senile cortical atrophy due to SDH and CAA leading to lobar hemorrhage (SICH) is possible in our patient. However, it is also possible that the hematoma or surrounding edema might have obscured and confused the evaluation of any potential structural pathology. After the bleeding and edema have subsided in these situations, delayed imaging may be used to find patients who have underlying structural abnormalities and are at a greater risk of experiencing SICH recurrence. Management of SICH requires immediate triage with aggressive care in the ICU or stroke unit with a focus on the management of acute bleeding, anticoagulant reversal, blood pressure management, and managing hemorrhagic expansion with intra-cranial pressure management. ICP monitoring with clinical features, invasive or imaging modalities is very crucial in the management of SICH. In most patients general and medical therapy for ICP management is sufficient. Emergent surgical intervention may be needed in some patients of SICH with clinical evidence of or concerning imaging features for rapidly progressive neurological dysfunction due to raised ICP. This was true for our case. Surgery to remove a hematoma in the case of supratentorial ICH is debatable since, in many instances, the risks associated with the procedure may outweigh any potential advantages (STICH). The patient subset that might benefit from surgical treatment has not been firmly established. The surgical intervention is reserved in most of the centers for patients who have supratentorial ICH that poses a life-threatening mass effect, and treatment plans are personalized based on assessments of the prognosis with and without surgical therapy. In our patient, craniotomy with tubular evacuation of the hematoma led to improvement in the symptoms and prevented the potential life-threatening herniation sequelae based on clinical examination. In the International Surgical Trial in IntraCerebral Hemorrhage (STICH) trial of 1033 patients with supratentorial ICH, those who had early surgical hematoma evacuation had similar favorable outcome rates as those who received maximum medical therapy. A trend toward favorable outcomes was observed among patients assigned to early surgery who had craniotomy as opposed to alternate techniques and in those with hematoma located 1 cm or less from the cortical surface. In the STICH II trial when comparing patients who received surgery to conservative care, the unfavorable functional outcome was similar at six months. However, individuals who received early surgery showed a trend toward lower mortality. Surgery was linked to lower mortality and a trend toward improved functional outcomes was observed in a systematic review that included 15 trials with more than 3000 patients with SICH, the benefit was greatest for people with worse prognoses at the time of presentation, people who got worse after they presented, and people who had superficial ICH without intraventricular extension. Supratentorial hematoma evacuation may decrease mortality in patients who are unconscious, have a big hematoma(\\xa0thickness greater than 10 mm or a\\xa0midline shift\\xa0greater than 5 mm on computed tomographic (CT) scan) with a major midline shift, or have excessive ICP that is resistant to medical therapy. Although it may lower mortality, supratentorial decompression with hematoma evacuation and/or decompressive hemicraniectomy does not necessarily lead to better functional outcomes. Even in these situations, judgments should be made individually. It should only be regarded as a life-saving operation to treat resistant increases in ICP. The most extensively researched surgical procedure for patients with supratentorial ICH is open craniotomy with craniectomy. Other procedures involving a craniotomy include minimally invasive surgical interventions like CT-guided stereotactic aspiration, endoscopic hemorrhage aspiration, and fibrinolytic treatment to remove the hematoma before aspiration. Minimally invasive surgical intervention is selected in some cases to address symptoms, large hemorrhage volume with midline shift, and peri-hemorrhagic brain edema with a primary goal to decrease mortality over functional outcomes. Management is still controversial between surgical and medical arms with more data about survival in minimally invasive brain approaches  Conclusions SICH involving the temporal lobe and concomitant with SAH and SDH is a rare entity. However, clinicians should be cautious as SICH can occur without hypertension, trauma, or ruptured AVM. With debatable benefits between conservative and surgical intervention, judgments should be made individually. Surgical evacuation of the hematoma should only be regarded as a life-saving operation to treat resistant increases in ICP. In all cases, conducting a comprehensive evaluation is essential, as it can assess the presence of intracerebral hemorrhage or surrounding swelling, which may impede and complicate the assessment of any underlying structural abnormalities that could be responsible for SICH.

       "  'title': 'Individualized intravenous thrombolytic strategy for acute ischemic stroke with large vessel occlusion on the era of mechanical thrombectomy: cases report',\n",
       "  'chunk': 'We analyzed the probable reasons and put forward thoughts from ourselves. Introduction Intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) for acute ischemic stroke within 4.5 h after the onset of symptoms, using recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rtPA) with the recommended dose of 0.9 mg/kg, is a standard therapy and recommended by various trials and guidelines. However, the appropriate dose is still being controversial considering the balance of effectiveness and safety. Some studies showed that low-dose rtPA was comparable with the standard-dose treatment in terms of effectiveness. In contrast, someone indicated that standard-dose intravenous rtPA could achieve more favorable outcome without increasing the risk of symptomatic hemorrhage than low-dose rtPA. Moreover, comparing with IVT, mechanical thrombectomy (MT) has been proved to be more effective for acute ischemic stroke with large vessel occlusion (AIS-LVO) due to the high rates of successful recanalization (modified TICI 2b–3 grades). The subgroup study of HERMES collaboration suggested that the effects favoring the intervention was significant in those not receiving intravenous alteplase. Therefore, the major controversy is that whether it is necessary to perform IVT before MT for AIS-LVO within the thrombolytic time window. We reported two cases of AIS-LVO that was treated by only IVT, and the dose of intravenous rtPA was controlled individually according to their timely angiography results. Case 1 Images of case 1. a Non-contrast CT: a hyperdense right MCA (black arrow). b Cerebral angiography: occlusion of the M1 segment of right MCA from frontal image. c Cerebral angiography: occlusion of the M1 segment of right MCA from lateral image. d Cerebral angiography: spontaneous recanalization of the M1 segment of right MCA before endovascular intervention. e Cerebral angiography: thrombus moving to MCA bifurcation 5 min later (black arrow). f Cerebral angiography: thrombus disappeared (black arrow) and complete recanalization of the right MCA. g Dyna-CT image: no hemorrhagic transformation. h Follow-up non-contrast CT at 24 h after IVT: right thalamus hemorrhage A 67-year-old male presented with sudden left limbs deficit was admitted to our hospital at 33 min after symptom onset. Non-contrast head CT was performed immediately (multimodal CT scan was not available at that time) and revealed no intracranial hemorrhage but with high- density on the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) M1 segment (Fig. 1a). The National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scored 14, and the patient was treated with IVT (rtPA 0.9 mg/kg × 78 kg) that followed by digital subtraction angiography (DSA). The first image of DSA showed that the right MCA M1 segment was occluded with a score of American Society of Interventional and Therapeutic Neuroradiology collateral grading (ACG) system 3 (Fig. 1b and c). However, the M1 segment was recanalization 6 min after the first DSA image, and the residual thrombus had immigrated to the M2 segment (Fig. 1d and e). Fortunately, the vessel achieved complete recanalization after another 5 min without any endovascular treatment in the whole process (Fig. 1f). Therefore, IVT was terminated in advance with a total dose of 42 mg (3/5 standard-dose, 0.54 mg/kg individually). The door-to-needle time (DNT), door-to-puncture time, onset-to-needle time, and onset-to-reperfusion time were 30 min, 58 min, 63 min, and 106 min, respectively. Immediate result of Dyna-CT scan (Artis zee biplane, Siemens, Germany) confirmed no intracranial hemorrhage (Fig. 1g), and the NIHSS score decreased to 1 at 24 h. However, asymptomatic intracranial hemorrhage in the infarction area was detected by the non-contrast CT imaging at 24 h, with class 3 of the Heidelberg Bleeding Classification (Fig. 1h). Finally, the modified Rankin Score (mRS) of the patient at 90 days was 0. Case 2 Images of case 2. a CT angiography: occlusion of the M1 upper branch of left MCA (white arrow). b CT perfusion: map of cerebral blood volume revealing low volume in the left frontal and parietal lobe (white dotted frame). c CT perfusion: map of cerebral blood flow revealing decreased flow in the left frontal and parietal lobe (white dotted frame). d Cerebral angiography: partial recanalization of the M1 upper branch with recovering forward flow and coil embolization assisted with stent for unruptured bifurcation aneurysm. e Cerebral angiography: residual thrombus in M1 bifurcation (black arrow). f Cerebral angiography: thrombus disappeared completely.'}]"

       " {'chunk': 'Left Atrial Appendage Closure: A Safe and Effective Alternative to Anticoagulation? To date, left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) devices continue to be assessed as an intuitive alternative to oral anticoagulant therapy to prevent embolic complications in patients with atrial fibrillation. Concerns remain about the up-front risks associated with device implantation as well as device efficacy in preventing embolic events as compared with anticoagulation. Currently, LAAC devices serve as a potential alternative to long-term anticoagulation with the benefit of decreased bleeding risk but with less protection against ischemic events. An individualized risk–benefit analysis with regard to stroke possibility, bleeding likelihood with long-term anticoagulation, the risks of an invasive procedure, and the risks associated with having a lifelong intracardiac device should be performed to guide careful patient selection for this operation. Introduction The association between atrial fibrillation (AF) and stroke is well-established, as is the efficacy for reducing stroke with oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy. On the basis of largely post-hoc analyses, the left atrial appendage (LAA) is believed to be the major source of thrombus leading to AF-associated embolic strokes. Currently, LAA closure (LAAC) devices are being assessed in an ongoing manner as an intuitive alternative to OAC therapy to prevent embolic events while lessening the risk of hemorrhagic complications. However, there are concerns about the upfront risks associated with device implantation as well as device efficacy in preventing embolic events as compared with anticoagulation. Percutaneous approaches to LAAC include implantable devices that occlude the LAA orifice, such as the WATCHMAN™ device (Boston Scientific Corp., Natick, MA, USA) and the AMPLATZER™ Amulet™ (Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, IL, USA) as well as the LARIAT® device (SentreHEART, Redwood City, CA, USA), a soft-tissue snare that cinches the LAA epicardially. In the United States, the WATCHMAN™ device (Boston Scientific Corp., Natick, MA, USA) is currently the only commercially available LAAC device and gained Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval following results from two multicenter randomized control trials (RCTs) and their associated continued access registries. The FDA indication for this device is to reduce the risk of thromboembolism from the LAA in patients with nonvalvular AF (NVAF) who (1) are at increased risk for stroke and are recommended for anticoagulation therapy, (2) do not have a contraindication to warfarin, and (3) have an appropriate reason to seek a nonpharmacologic alternative to warfarin. The road to Food and Drug Administration approval The first Watchman RCT, the Watchman Left Atrial Appendage System for Embolic Protection in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation (PROTECT AF) study, randomized 707 patients with NVAF and a CHADS2 score of 1 or greater in a 2:1 ratio to either a WATCHMAN™ (n = 463) group or a warfarin (n = 244) group. The use of the WATCHMAN™ device (Boston Scientific Corp., Natick, MA, USA) was found to be noninferior to warfarin for the primary composite efficacy endpoint of stroke, systemic embolization (SE), and cardiovascular/unexplained death, both at 1,065 (mean: 1.5 years) and 2,621 patient-years (mean: 3.8 years) of follow-up. This finding was driven by lower rates of hemorrhagic stroke and fatal hemorrhagic stroke in the device arm. The hemorrhagic stroke incidence was 10 times higher in the warfarin arm than in the device arm at 1.5 years (2.5% versus 0.2%) and 3.8 years (4% versus 0.6%). Additionally, the rate of cardiovascular/unexplained death was lower in the device arm, with an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 5.3% at 3.8 years. This was driven by the lower rate of fatal hemorrhagic stroke in the warfarin arm (p = 0.004), as eight of the 10 hemorrhagic strokes were fatal. Notably, several issues were raised with regard to the hemorrhagic stroke signal in PROTECT AF. FDA reviewers noted an uneven adjudication of hemorrhagic stroke between the study arms. Of the 10 hemorrhagic stroke events in the warfarin arm, five occurred after falls, four were associated with a subdural hematoma (SDH), and one was associated with a subarachnoid hemorrhage. In current guidelines, hemorrhagic stroke is by definition not caused by trauma. In the WATCHMAN™ arm, three subjects also fell and had SDH; however, these cases were categorized as intracranial bleeding events rather than hemorrhagic stroke. In total, there were five reported intracranial bleeding events in the WATCHMAN™ group and one in the warfarin group. Combining the reported hemorrhagic strokes with intracranial bleeds, there were seven events in the WATCHMAN™ group and 11 events in the warfarin group. Although in the study protocol, hemorrhagic stroke diagnosis required imaging confirmation, one control subject did not have imaging confirmation, but the reporting physician deemed it likely she had experienced such. Another control arm patient, although appropriately included in the intention-to-treat analysis, had been off warfarin for more than 38 months at the time of the hemorrhagic stroke and was taking acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) alone. Four control group patients were taking ASA in addition to warfarin at the time of the hemorrhagic event, making it difficult to assess the contribution of the concomitant antiplatelet (APT) medication. Lastly, the hemorrhagic stroke incidence in the warfarin arm of PROTECT AF, at 1.1 per 100 patient-years, was at least two times higher than the hemorrhagic stroke risk of warfarin in contemporary OAC trials, where the incidence has been consistently 0.4 to 0.5 per 100 patient-years. To this end, the signal toward reduced hemorrhagic stroke with the WATCHMAN™ device (Boston Scientific Corp., Natick, MA, USA) is attenuated by the inconsistent adjudication of hemorrhagic stroke events, the lack of imaging confirmation in one subject, the concomitant use of APT medication in several subjects with hemorrhage, the small sample size leading to potentially spurious results, and the significantly higher rate of hemorrhagic stroke in the warfarin arm as compared with in recent OAC trials. The lower rate of cardiovascular/unexplained death, fatal hemorrhagic stroke, and overall lower hemorrhagic stroke rate in the WATCHMAN™ arm was not reproduced in the later Evaluation of the WATCHMAN™ LAAC Device in Patients with AF versus Long-term Warfarin Therapy (PREVAIL) trial. The hemorrhagic stroke rate in the PREVAIL control group (0.67 per 100 patient-years) was in the range observed in the warfarin groups of contemporary OAC trials. Embolic event rates are the usual comparator in AF therapies and have been consistently higher with use of the WATCHMAN™ device (Boston Scientific Corp., Natick, MA, USA) versus with warfarin. The rates of ischemic stroke for the device and drug arms were 5.2% (24/463) versus 4.1% (10/244) at 3.8 years, and three SE events occurred in the device arm only. Combining ischemic stroke and SE events, warfarin had an ARR of 1.7% at 3.8 years. Early in the PROTECT AF study, several ischemic strokes were caused by air emboli, which improved with operator experience. When excluding procedural ischemic events, the ischemic events in PROTECT AF were not statistically different between the WATCHMAN™ and warfarin groups. However, skepticism was raised regarding the low-risk patient population. The average CHADS2 score was just 2.2 and more than 30% of patients had a CHADS2 score of 1, which may have made it easier to establish noninferiority for the composite endpoint. There was also concern that the concomitant use of antithrombotic medications and indefinite ASA played a role in the already modest efficacy observed in the WATCHMAN™ arm. Although the FDA had reservations about efficacy, the main concern was the early adverse event rate of 8.7% within seven days of implant. Because of safety events that occurred early on in the trial, use of the WATCHMAN™ device (Boston Scientific Corp., Natick, MA, USA) was deemed inferior to warfarin in terms of the primary safety endpoint, a composite of major bleeding or procedure-related complications, at 1.8 years, but it did meet noninferiority at 3.8 years. The PREVAIL trial was the second RCT to consider the WATCHMAN™ device (Boston Scientific Corp., Natick, MA, USA) and was designed in part to address these concerns. The focus of PREVAIL was to demonstrate that safety improvements observed during the second half of the PROTECT AF trial could be reproduced and successfully adopted by new centers. PREVAIL had similar enrollment criteria as those of the PROTECT AF study but included higher-risk patients, presented a mean CHADS2 score of 2.6, and excluded patients with an indication for long-term clopidogrel therapy. Bayesian statistical methods allowed an efficacy composite to be studied in what was planned to be a smaller trial incorporating PROTECT AF data with a discounted weight of 50%. As it turned out, warfarin was superior to the WATCHMAN™ device (Boston Scientific Corp., Natick, MA, USA) for the PREVAIL trial’s composite primary efficacy endpoint of stroke, SE, and cardiovascular/unexplained death. Patients using the device had higher rates of each of the following events in comparison with those using warfarin: ischemic stroke (1.9% versus 0.7%), hemorrhagic stroke (0.4% versus 0%), death (2.6% versus 2.2%), and SE (0.4% versus 0%). The total number of events, however, was still very small; for example, the number of ischemic strokes/SE in the device arm was six of 269, versus one of 138 in the warfarin arm. The second primary efficacy endpoint in PREVAIL was “late” ischemic stroke or SE occurring at greater than seven days after randomization. This was intended to answer the proof-of-concept questions, “is the LAA the source of embolism in NVAF?” and “do LAAC devices offer the same protection from ischemic events as OAC after overcoming the procedural risks?” Although the late ischemic event signal was higher in the device group (2.53%) versus the drug group (2%), the 18-month risk difference was statistically noninferior. In the July 2014 publication of PREVAIL, only 28% of patients were reported to have reached the planned 18-month follow-up point. Updated data released later revealed eight additional ischemic strokes in the device arm, for a total of 14 ischemic events (5.2%), versus one event (0.7%) in the warfarin arm. Of the 14 ischemic events, only one was caused during the procedure; thus, these new results suggested that the WATCHMAN™ device (Boston Scientific Corp., Natick, MA, USA) was now inferior to warfarin for the proof-of-concept late ischemic endpoint. The trialists suggested that PREVAIL was not powered to detect differences in ischemic stroke and pointed to PREVAIL’s overperforming warfarin arm (0.34 events/100 patient-years) as the reason for the difference. However, when comparing the ischemic stroke risk seen with the WATCHMAN™ device (Boston Scientific Corp., Natick, MA, USA) to that with the warfarin arms of contemporary OAC trials with similar CHADS2 scores, the risk with device use was still greater at 2.3 events per 100 patient-years versus between one event and 1.4 events per 100 patient-years for warfarin. A patient-level meta-analysis combining the two RCTs further assessed the signals of increased ischemic stroke in the WATCHMAN™ (n = 732) arm as compared with in the warfarin arm (n = 382). The meta-analysis results were unsurprisingly similar to the results of the 3.8-year follow-up of the PROTECT AF trial, which provided the majority of patient data. At a mean follow-up of four years, the pooled primary composite endpoint met noninferiority. Participants in the device arm had higher rates of ischemic stroke and SE (45/732; 6.1% versus 14/382; 3.6%), but the difference was not statistically significant. The difference in hemorrhagic stroke was, however, significant in a manner that favored the device arm (5/732; 0.6% versus 13/382; 3.4%; p = 0.002). Notably, the hemorrhagic stroke events were driven entirely by PROTECT AF; thus, the concerns about the hemorrhagic stroke signal raised by the FDA still apply here. In addition, there were significant differences in disabling stroke (1.8% versus 3.9%; p = 0.03) and all-cause mortality (14.5% versus 19.1%; p = 0.02), driven by the difference in fatal hemorrhagic stroke in PROTECT AF, as well as in nonprocedural major bleeds (6.5% versus 13.3%; p = 0.003), respectively, favoring the device. When including procedural bleeding, major bleeds were similar between the groups. Despite the signal toward increased ischemic stroke/SE with use of the WATCHMAN™ device (Boston Scientific Corp., Natick, MA, USA), PREVAIL was not powered to demonstrate individual efficacy endpoints and the meta-analysis did not show a statistical difference. The prime directive for PREVAIL was to satisfy the safety concerns raised in PROTECT AF, which it successfully did; specifically, the composite of early procedure-related complications decreased to 4.2% in PREVAIL. This improvement and the totality of data from the RCTs was sufficiently convincing enough that the third FDA panel voted in favor of approval for the WATCHMAN™ device (Boston Scientific Corp., Natick, MA, USA) in March 2015 and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services subsequently agreed to pay for the procedure. The most frequent serious complication seen in PROTECT AF, cardiac tamponade, improved from a rate of 4.3% in PROTECT AF to 1.9% in PREVAIL and then to 1.02% in safety monitoring data following FDA approval of the device. The rates of procedure-related stroke (0.18%), device embolization (0.25%), and procedure-related mortality (0.06%) also improved significantly.',\n",

Hemorrhagic stroke comprises 10-20% of strokes. Here, we present a case report of hemorrhagic stroke that may have been secondary to untreated Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) in a young man\\xa0with no other cardiovascular risk factors or features of metabolic syndrome. A\\xa032-year-old man\\xa0was admitted for hemorrhagic stroke. An initial thorough workup for the etiology of stroke was inconclusive. Eventually, a polysomnography was done, which demonstrated OSA suggesting that untreated OSA may have contributed to his stroke. OSA may cause hemorrhagic stroke by nocturnal blood pressure surge. So, all physicians should consider doing polysomnography for unexplained hemorrhagic stroke or in patients at risk. Diagnosing and treating OSA would be critical in preventing hemorrhagic stroke and its recurrences. Introduction Stroke is the second common cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide; hemorrhagic stroke contributes to 10-20% of all strokes. Hypertension is a well-established risk factor for hemorrhagic stroke. In some patients, the etiology remains unclear and bizarre. This is a report on one such patient, who did not have any apparent risk factors. The association between ischemic stroke and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been known since 1999 and several studies have examined the relationship between OSA and ischemic stroke using the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) as the measurement tool. The AHI measures the severity of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) by the number of apnea and hypopneas per hour of sleep. Here we describe a case of hemorrhagic stroke possibly caused because of untreated OSA in the absence of any risk factors. Case presentation A 32-year-old Chinese man presented to the emergency department at 3 AM, with weakness and inability to mobilize resulting in a fall. His symptoms began as a sudden onset of left-sided headache, which started four hours earlier during sexual intercourse. Following this, he developed right-sided weakness, facial droop and two episodes of vomiting. The weakness was profound four hours later, resulting in an inability to walk, which subsequently led to a fall. On examination, body mass index was 23.3 kg/m2 and blood pressure (BP) was 135/93 mm Hg. He was drowsy but rousable, Glasgow Coma Scale score was 11/15 [E4V1M6]. Pupils were symmetric and equally reactive to light. The extra-ocular range of movement was full, with no nystagmus. Motor power on the left was 5/5 in both upper and lower extremities. Best motor power in the right upper extremity was 2/5, while in the lower extremity it was 1/5.',\n",

Hemorrhages have classically been described as a contraindication for mechanical thrombectomy. However, the natural course of a large vessel occlusion with or without decompressive hemicraniectomy is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This paper investigates the origin of the contraindication for mechanical thrombectomy, the natural history of large vessel occlusion, risks of craniectomy, and risks of mechanical thrombectomy. Given the likelihood of poor outcomes without intervention, mechanical thrombectomy could be considered in select individuals, but future studies into the natural course of contralateral ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes would better guide management. Introduction Strokes is the number one cause of adult disability and the fourth leading cause of death in the United States with costs in 2009 both direct and indirect totaling around $68.9 billion. Strokes impact approximately seven million individuals in the United States, about 3% of the adult population. However, not all strokes are created equal. Approximately 87% of strokes are ischemic with the remaining being hemorrhagic. Mortality rates associated with ischemic strokes are approximately 57.4%\\xa0with a subset of those with proximal vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation having a 60-80% mortality in 90 days or inability to regain functional independence. Acute ischemic stroke care has evolved over time with studies proving the benefits of acute intervention, such as intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular thrombectomy which can significantly improve a patient’s functional outcome.

The complexity of this case was magnified by the patient’s young age, a mechanical heart valve (MHV), and a need for anticoagulation to maintain MHV patency in a setting of potentially life-threatening intracranial hemorrhage. Anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy are risk factors for hemorrhagic conversion post-cerebral ischemia; however, the pathophysiology underlying endothelial cell dysfunction causing red blood cell extravasation is an active area of basic and clinical research. The need for randomized clinical trials to aid in the creation of standardized treatment protocol continues to go unmet. Consequently, there is marked variation in therapeutic approaches to treating intracranial hemorrhage in patients with an MHV. Unfortunately, patients with an MHV are considered at high thromboembolic (TE) risk, and these patients are often excluded from clinical trials of acute stroke due to their increased TE potential. The authors feel this case represents an example of endothelial dysfunction secondary to microthrombotic events originating from an MHV, which caused ischemic stroke with hemorrhagic conversion complicated by the need for anticoagulation for an MHV. This case offers a definitive treatment algorithm for a complex clinical dilemma.',\n",

       " {'chunk': '(C) Occlusion (arrow) of the M1 segment of the left MCA (D) and successful recanalization of TICI 3. Discussion Anticoagulation management in patients with atrial fibrillation is a delicate balance between preventing thromboembolism and minimizing the risk of hemorrhagic complications. Our case highlights this clinical challenge, particularly in the context of acute ischemic stroke. The self-discontinuation of apixaban in our patient precipitated an initial ischemic stroke, which was effectively managed by MT. However, he later suffered from a bilateral MCA occlusion after withholding apixaban due to a minor hemorrhagic conversion. The early start of anticoagulation after an ischemic CVA can increase the risk of hemorrhagic transformation. This risk is especially high in patients with large infarcts, elevated blood pressure, cardioembolic etiologies, and those who received thrombolytic therapy. The resultant intracerebral hemorrhage can lead to significantly worse neurological outcomes, including increased disability and mortality. Individuals with a CHA2DS2-VASC score of 9 have a 12.2% annual risk of ischemic CVA, and oral anticoagulation provides a 75% relative risk reduction. Furthermore, the risk of recurrent stroke is elevated in the initial 4-week period. Factors such as blood-brain barrier breakdown, impaired cerebral autoregulation, and increased local inflammation may contribute to an increased risk of hemorrhagic transformation after an ischemic event. Therefore, the resumption of anticoagulation must be based on a careful determination of risks and benefits. Few cases of bilateral MCA occlusions requiring MT have been reported in the literature. Story et al reported the case of a 64-year-old woman who had AF and held apixaban for 5 days before a cerebral angiogram who developed bilateral MCA occlusions. The patient underwent successful bilateral MT with TICI 3 revascularization. Current strategies to determine the resumption of anticoagulation after an ischemic CVA include both an imaging-based and clinical approach. The rule “1-2-3-4 days” adopts a clinical approach based on the NIHSS to determine when to start direct oral anticoagulation (DOAC). This study involved a cohort of 1797 patients derived from a Japanese stroke registry that determined that early initiation of DOAC within 1, 2, 3, or 4 days was reasonable to decrease the risk of recurrent CVA, but also a major bleeding event. The “1-2-3-4 day” rule recommends the following: (a) Mild stroke (NIHSS < 8) DOAC initiation 2 days after the event. (2) Moderate stroke (NIHSS 8–15) DOAC initiation 3 days after the ischemic event and after evaluating for hemorrhagic transformation on CT or MRI on the same day of initiation. (3) Severe stroke (NIHSS > 16) DOAC initiation 4 days after the ischemic event and after evaluating for hemorrhagic transformation on CT or MRI on the same day of initiation. Taking this study into account, the ideal time to restart apixaban in our case was appropriately delayed given the hemorrhagic conversion. In clinical practice, caution is exhibited due to limitations and complicating factors when only using a clinical-based marker such as the NIHSS when making decisions. For example, many patients are admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) after a CVA and develop superimposed delirium that can artificially inflate the NIHSS. The TIMING trial is a Swedish registry-based cohort study of 888 patients that determined that early initiation of DOAC was not inferior to delayed start after acute ischemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. In 2020, a survey with 238 responses from stroke specialists in the United States (ACT-SAFe) was completed on the best practices of reinstatement of anticoagulation after an ischemic stroke. For a mild ischemic stroke occupying <1/3 of the MCA territory without hemorrhagic conversion or thrombolysis, 51% of the respondents chose to anticoagulate within the first 4 days. In patients with a large MCA territory stroke (>1/2 MCA territory), evidence of hemorrhagic conversion or cerebellar infarct > 60 ccs, 65% of the respondents chose to wait at least 7 days before starting anticoagulation. In addition, a prior study determined that individuals with an ischemic stroke with AF would benefit from DOAC initiation without bridging therapy. Prior clinical trials have also established that DOACs are just as effective as vitamin-K antagonists (e.g. Coumadin) at preventing recurrent AF-related ischemic stroke. Close monitoring, including frequent neurological checks, is a cornerstone of effective management in patients who have had an acute ischemic stroke, especially when anticoagulation has been paused. Regular assessments allow healthcare providers to quickly identify any neurological changes that may indicate the onset of recurrent stroke or hemorrhagic conversion. These checks often involve repeated measures of consciousness, motor strength, language, vision, and other neurological functions using standardized tools such as the NIHSS. In addition, close monitoring can guide the timing of when to safely reintroduce anticoagulation, as any sign of clinical stabilization or improvement may indicate a lower risk for hemorrhagic conversion. This case encourages further research on optimal strategies and standardized international guidelines for anticoagulation management in the context of recent cerebral infarction to minimize both ischemic and hemorrhagic risks. These guidelines should incorporate both clinical and imaging data to provide an individualized approach, tailoring decisions based on factors such as the patient’s age, overall health status, stroke severity, and specific imaging findings like the size of the infarct or the presence of hemorrhagic conversion. The guidelines would also benefit from including clear protocols on when and how to safely discontinue and resume anticoagulation. The development of such guidelines would contribute significantly to standardizing care, reducing variability in treatment approaches, and potentially improving patient outcomes. Future randomized controlled studies that incorporate both clinical and imaging-based strategies to determine the optimal timing of anticoagulation in ischemic CVA with AF are needed. Despite the complexity of his clinical course, the outcomes of our patient were favorable, in part, due to the prompt recognition of his condition and the immediate intervention with thrombectomy. However, his residual symptoms underscore the potential severity of the neurological sequelae of such events. In addition, this case emphasizes the vital importance of patient education and compliance with anticoagulant medication. The temporary cessation of apixaban may have contributed to the development of the first and subsequent ischemic strokes of the patient. Hence, ensuring that patients understand the critical importance of consistent anticoagulant use is essential to prevent similar instances. This case serves as a valuable lesson for clinicians in managing similar future cases. Conclusions In the management of patients with atrial fibrillation, it is critical to balance the prevention of thromboembolism and mitigation of hemorrhagic risk, particularly in the setting of acute ischemic stroke. The impact of discontinuing anticoagulation, as illustrated in this case, can be severe and life-threatening. Prompt intervention with mechanical thrombectomy proved vital in managing acute stroke events in this patient, with a relatively favorable outcome despite multiple cerebral infarctions. This case underscores the need for patient education on the importance of medication compliance and highlights the need for further research into optimal anticoagulation management strategies in the context of a recent cerebral infarction. This includes timely initiation and discontinuation of therapy, individualization of care based on patient characteristics, and considering the extent of brain infarction and hemorrhagic conversion. Furthermore, this case highlights the effectiveness of mechanical thrombectomy in minimizing this rare bilateral occlusive event of the large cerebral vessels.

Her hospital course consisted of observation in the ICU and blood pressure management. The case illustrates that intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) can sometimes present indolently and does not always require surgical intervention. Introduction Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) accounts for 15% of all strokes and 50% of stroke-related mortality, which equates to approximately 2.8 million deaths globally every year. In 2010, hemorrhagic strokes accounted for nearly a third of 33 million stroke cases and had a mortality rate of just over 50% worldwide. Two major risk factors for ICH are age and anticoagulant use. The overall increase in life expectancy means a larger aging population, which translates to an increased incidence of ICH. ICH is more prevalent in older persons, and older persons are also more likely to be on an anticoagulant agent. Other risk factors for ICH are being part of non-white ethnicity, being male, older age, and having familial apolipoprotein syndromes. Other risk factors also include cerebral amyloid angiopathy, uncontrolled or untreated hypertension, and drug abuse (i.e.'},\n",

       "  'chunk': 'A Case Report Examining a Contraindication for Mechanical Thrombectomy in the Setting of a Large Vessel Occlusion and a Concurrent Contralateral Intracranial Hemorrhage An acute ischemic stroke occurring contralateral to a hemorrhagic stroke is an uncommon occurrence that presents unique challenges. Hemorrhages have classically been described as a contraindication for mechanical thrombectomy. However, the natural course of a large vessel occlusion with or without decompressive hemicraniectomy is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This paper investigates the origin of the contraindication for mechanical thrombectomy, the natural history of large vessel occlusion, risks of craniectomy, and risks of mechanical thrombectomy. Given the likelihood of poor outcomes without intervention, mechanical thrombectomy could be considered in select individuals, but future studies into the natural course of contralateral ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes would better guide management. Introduction Strokes is the number one cause of adult disability and the fourth leading cause of death in the United States with costs in 2009 both direct and indirect totaling around $68.9 billion. Strokes impact approximately seven million individuals in the United States, about 3% of the adult population. However, not all strokes are created equal. Approximately 87% of strokes are ischemic with the remaining being hemorrhagic. Mortality rates associated with ischemic strokes are approximately 57.4%\\xa0with a subset of those with proximal vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation having a 60-80% mortality in 90 days or inability to regain functional independence. Acute ischemic stroke care has evolved over time with studies proving the benefits of acute intervention, such as intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular thrombectomy which can significantly improve a patient’s functional outcome. The following is a case that demonstrates the nuance in a broad guideline that merits further investigation.'},\n",

       "  'chunk': 'Computed tomography-negative symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage in a patient with cerebral small vessel disease Abstract Rationale: Computed tomography plays a key role in the initial evaluation of suspected acute stroke by ruling out the possibility of hemorrhage before thrombolysis. Recently, many reports have described cases of symptomatic microbleeds, and there may also have been a case of computed tomography- negative intracerebral hemorrhage. Patient concerns: A 70-year-old female patient who had a history of lacunar infarction and severe small vessel disease developed dysarthria. On brain non-contrast computed tomography there was no evidence of intracerebral hemorrhage. However, brain magnetic resonance imaging performed at 3\\u200ahours after the initial computed tomography showed cerebral hemorrhage. Diagnoses: The diagnosis was computed tomography-negative intracerebral hemorrhage. Interventions: The patient was treated with cilostazole 100\\u200amg twice a day with blood pressure management. Outcomes: The dysarthria was fully recovered within 5 days and the patient did not suffer recurrent stroke symptoms over the following 2 years. Lessons: In patients with underlying severe small vessel disease and microbleeds, there could be computed tomography-negative hemorrhage and susceptibility weighted magnetic resonance image could be needed. More attention is required before applying thrombolysis therapy because there is a possibility of cerebral hemorrhage in those patients. Introduction Stroke is an emergent disease which results in death and severe disability. However, in many cases it can be reversed by timely treatment such as intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular thrombectomy. Thus, prompt diagnosis and treatment are necessary to minimize stroke-induced disability, and brain imaging plays a major role in determining treatment strategy. Non-contrast brain computed tomography (NCCT) is commonly used to differentiate hemorrhage from ischemia because it takes a short time and has high sensitivity for detecting cerebral hemorrhage. Intravenous thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is first line treatment in ischemic stroke patients who present within 4.5\\u200ahours. However, hemorrhagic complications were found to develop in 21.3% of patients and symptomatic hemorrhage in 5.6%. Once hemorrhagic complications occur, neurologic symptom may deteriorate and patients may have poor outcomes. Thus, intravenous thrombolysis should only be undertaken after careful examination of early brain images for signs of potential hemorrhagic. The authors encountered a case of a patient with acute cerebral hemorrhage in whom early brain NCCT gave no evidence of bleeding but magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated hemorrhage. Ruling out cerebral hemorrhage by brain CT may be insufficient, especially in patients with a history of severe small vessel disease and lacunar infarction. We describe this case with emphasis on the need for caution in employing intravenous thrombolysis in such patients. Case report A 70-year-old woman visited the emergency room with dysarthria that had started 5\\u200ahours earlier. She had been diagnosed with hypertension 11 years previously and took regular medication. She had also been diagnosed with corona radiata infarction, severe white matter change and multiple microbleeds 8 months earlier and was taking 100\\u200amg of cilostazole twice a day (Fig. 1).'},\n",

       "  'chunk': \"Outcome measures used in this patient are the Functional Independence of Measures (FIM) scale, Brunnstrom\\xa0grading, voluntary control grading, and the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). Introduction Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is the term used to describe any bleeding that takes place inside the intracranial vault, which comprises the brain parenchyma and surrounding meningeal spaces. Epidural hemorrhage, subdural hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and intraparenchymal hemorrhage are the four main kinds of intracranial bleeding. It can be difficult to differentiate between ICH and an ischemic stroke in acute presentation. The symptoms of an ICH rather than an ischemic stroke include coma, headache, vomiting, seizures, neck stiffness, and high diastolic blood pressure (BP), but only neuroimaging can make a definitive diagnosis. Stroke patients must first improve their general physical condition and fundamental daily living skills before improving their hand movement and hand muscle strength for instrumental activities of daily living training\\xa0. Similar to ICH without an underlying lesion, there is typically little evidence to recommend surgically removing the hemorrhage. Reflex-inhibiting movement patterns by Bobath assure\\xa0that normal tone is maintained in the affected limb and the development of abnormal movement patterns is prevented. She also says that for complete rehabilitation, incorporating the affected upper limb into all everyday tasks is essential. Unfortunately, like with all motor remediation theories, empirical data supporting the use of this approach is still inconclusive. When a blood artery inside the brain or between the skull and brain bursts, it causes an intracranial hematoma. The brain tissue is compressed by blood accumulation (hematoma). Brain tissue is compressed by the hematoma, a blood clump. A cerebral hematoma is potentially life-threatening and frequently requires rapid treatment, but some head injuries, such as those that merely result in momentary loss of consciousness\\xa0may be minor. CT scans are extremely useful for diagnosing hematomas. Generally, clinicians assume that progressive loss of consciousness associated with a head injury can be attributed to bleeding in the skull. In this latter group, the majority of the study on the advantages of surgery has been conducted. To remove the blood, surgery is frequently but not always necessary for cerebral hematomas. In a decompressive craniectomy (DC), a section of the skull is cut away to provide space for enlarged brain tissue. Although it has been used for many years to manage patients with brain edema and/or intracranial hypertension, its current use in therapy is debatable. Patients with malignant middle cerebral artery stroke have higher survival rates after DC, but some of them still experience moderate-to-severe impairment. When treating individuals with diffuse traumatic brain damage, an early (neuroprotective) DC is not more effective than standard medical care. Stroke places a tremendous burden on health resources worldwide. The incidence of stroke is currently substantially greater in India than in Western industrialized nations. In stroke, only a few possible symptoms include headache, nausea, convulsions, and localized or generalized neurologic problems. Deep structures are more prone to experience hypertension-related ICH, and as BP increases, the risk of ICH increases as well. Other risk factors for ICH include heredity, alcohol use, and low total serum cholesterol levels. Due to stroke, the patient's\\xa0quality of life gets affected as it has a direct\\xa0impact on\\xa0health systems; serious disabilities and functional limitations lead to compromised quality of life. Case presentation Patient information The 45-year-old female patient came to the hospital with flaccidity of the right upper and lower limbs. Bed mobility was very challenging for her. There were no sensory issues or deformities. Previously, she was affected by strokes twice, for which she underwent medical and physiotherapy treatment in the early stages. She had been taking medicine for her hypertension for the past two years. Now, after two years, she was affected by the same condition and got admitted in July for further treatment. On investigation, the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\\xa0revealed an area of blood density attenuation with multiple air foci in the left gangliocapsular region. An intracranial hemorrhage was observed on a CT scan of the brain. In this case, she underwent a decompressive craniotomy. After 36 hours of monitoring in the intensive care unit (ICU), she was shifted to the surgery ward for further management. Clinical findings In terms of time, place, and people, the patient was orientated. The vital signs were as follows: temperature 95.5 °F, BP\\xa0130/79 mmHg, pulse 63 beats per minute, respiration rate 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 98%. On neurological assessment, the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scored 7 as severe. A score of 30 was also determined as severe by the NIHSS. According to the modified Rankin scale (mRS), the patient scored\\xa05. The affected right upper limb and right lower limb were supported with a pillow. Ryle’s tube was attached for feeding.

       "  'chunk': 'There was not much difference in initial hematoma volume on CT scan (28.6 mL for group A, and 25 mL for group B). Interestingly, three patients showed progression of hematoma without evidence of rebleeding from a clipped aneurysm. This is why we concluded that remaining hematoma itself is a major triggering factor for progression of cerebral swelling. Removal of hematoma in case 2 was relatively easier than case 1. Massive hematoma enabled simple suction procedure in operation. In contrast, it was impossible because of arachnoid adhesion and sticky hematoma in case 2. Brain retraction to remove hematoma and small vein coagulation for bleeding control would aggravate progression of secondary cerebral brain swelling on POD 2. According to Jickling et al., a delayed hemorrhagic transformation occurs after 18 to 24 hours of stroke onset for several weeks, and the mechanism contributes to the processes involved in delayed blood-brain-barrier (BBB) opening after stroke. Removal of the blood clot in the intrasylvian hematoma is very difficult. Unlike hypertensive ICH that results from small lenticulostriate arteries and forms the global hematoma capsule and homogeneous character, intrasylvian hematoma consists of blood clot, thick arachnid trabecular, fibrin, and brain debrides. It is impossible to remove by simple aspiration, and, sometimes, coagulation and removal with brain retraction may be necessary.'},\n",

       "  'chunk': 'observed an incidence of 8% infarcts in their cohort of 212 patients with SICH. Prabhakaran et al. detected a 22.9% prevalence of associated infarcts as evidenced by diffusion-weighted image (DWI) abnormalities in a cohort of 118 SICH patients. The majority of these infarcts, however, were small subcortical and subclinical. Large vessel occlusion causing malignant cerebral infarction has been rarely reported. We add a case of vermian hematoma with infarct to our earlier reported two cases of malignant infarction following evacuation of a supratentorial SICH. Several mechanisms have been postulated to explain the possible occurrence of an infarct following a spontaneous hematoma. The majority of such infarcts are small and subcortical, conforming to border-zone or single perforator territories. Few recent studies have observed subclinical DWI lesions in 15% of patients with acute intracerebral hematoma (ICH) attributable to cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Since both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke share common risk factors and certain common pathogenic mechanisms, it is possible that an ischemic stroke may simply be a co-occurrence in the presence of common risk factors. Hypotension due to attempted aggressive reduction of BP following a hypertensive bleed may precipitate an ischemic event. Surgery for evacuation of the hematoma may be associated with intraoperative hemodynamic instability, which can result in an ischemic event. Though unlikely, infarcts following craniotomy may also be attributable to iatrogenic compression of vascular structures during craniotomy or through the durotomy defects. Large hematomas with surrounding edema can theoretically directly compress the adjacent cerebral vessels causing ischemia. Infection with persistent fever, dehydration, and electrolytic imbalance can all result in a hypercoagulable state following a bleed and can result in ischemia. One another postulated mechanism for ischemia is the massive release of blood and blood breakdown products into the CSF and subsequent inflammatory changes in the smooth muscle of the large cerebral arteries. Cerebral vasospasm, due to the presence of concomitant intraventricular hemorrhage or after indirect vessel manipulation at the time of craniotomy, is another suspected mechanism for ischemia. After acute brain injury, autoregulation may be abolished such that cerebral blood flow is linearly related to cerebral perfusion pressure. Aggressive BP lowering beyond the lower limits of cerebral autoregulation might induce cerebral ischemia in chronic hypertensive ICH patients. Our patient did not undergo surgery and the infarct and hematoma were located in different compartments. He did develop features of early sepsis while under treatment for vermian hematoma. Sepsis with an associated hypercoagulable state may be the precipitating factor resulting in the infarct. Attempts have been made to predict the risk of developing concomitant infarcts in patients with SICH. Wang et al. observed that the presence of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), hydrocephalus, the volume of intracranial hematoma, and neurosurgical intervention were important predictors of infarction of which IVH had the most statistical significance. Similarly, Prabhakaran et al. observed that the factors independently associated with DWI abnormality were a prior ischemic stroke, lowering of mean arterial pressure by over 40%, and craniotomy for ICH evacuation. Our patient did have the evidence of fourth ventricular blood but did not satisfy most of the above criteria. The rarity of such complications makes it less likely to appear in our clinical diagnosis and we feel one should consider this scenario as well. The remote site hemorrhages which are often encountered after tumor or hematoma decompressive surgery are shown in Table 1. The varied cases of remote site bleed following tumor excision and decompression The exact etiopathogenesis of these large infarcts remains uncertain and the management of such large infarcts needs to be on similar lines as for any ischemic infarct. The outcome, however, is usually grave. Conclusion Stroke physicians need to be aware that SICH patients have a potential threat of developing large vessel occlusion with malignant cerebral infarcts, especially after surgical decompression. Although the exact pathogenesis is unknown, size of the clot, IVH, hydrocephalus, and aggressive reduction of BP appear to be predictive factors. Financial support and sponsorship Nil.'},\n",

       "  'chunk': 'Laboratory findings revealed no evidence of vasculitis, infections, and coagulation disorders. Transthoracic echocardiography showed rheumatic heart disease with severe aortic stenosis and decreased left ventricular diastolic function. The ischemia was classified as ICA occlusion due to cardioembolic stroke. Warfarin was initiated after 2\\u2009weeks. Three months later, she underwent elective aortic valve replacement and continued long-term warfarin therapy. She could self-care after a follow-up period of 6\\u2009months and had modified Rankin Scale of 2. Discussion and conclusions Nontraumatic SAH is mainly caused by aneurysm rupture, but not all cases have an aneurysmal origin. cSAH is a rare and heterogeneous entity, and is characterized by bleeding along the cortical convexity. The prevalence of cSAH is reported to be 5–18% of all spontaneous SAH. Diverse causes of cSAH have been described including CAA, reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS), posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, ICA stenosis or occlusion, cerebral venous thrombosis, drug misuse, vasculitis, vascular malformation, brain tumors and abscesses. cSAH may occur simultaneously with acute ischemic stroke, but this co-occurrence is particularly rare. There are various reasons for this association, such as ICA stenosis or occlusion, artery dissection, RCVS, CAA, and cardioembolism. However, the most common cause of cSAH with acute ischemic stroke is ICA stenosis or occlusion. Moreover, cSAH has been described to occur invariably on the side with acute ischemic stroke, and it is notably unusual for cSAH to occur on the opposite side of the infarct territory. To date, there have been few reports about infarction with contralateral cSAH caused by RCVS, ICA dissection, embolic stroke of undetermined source, and CAA. This paper presented two cases of acute ischemic stroke with contralateral cSAH due to ICA atherosclerotic occlusion and cardioembolic stroke, respectively. The pathophysiology of the association between acute ischemic stroke and cSAH is not fully understood. The current leading theory suggests that cSAH may occur in the setting of severe atherosclerotic stenosis or large artery occlusion, potentially by a mechanism similar to hemorrhage caused by moyamoya disease, the acute alteration in hemodynamics may lead to cSAH. Plaque rupture leads to further atherothrombotic narrowing, while acute hypertension results in the spontaneous rupture of fragile collateral vessels. Further, another theory suggests that emboli to marginally perfused vessels can cause necrosis and rupture. In case 1 in our study, ICA occlusion had an influence on the hemispheric cerebral blood flow of both the occluded and contralateral sides. We speculate that increased contralateral leptomeningeal flow towards the occluded side may have caused cSAH. The establishment of collateral circulation can lead to hemodynamic changes on the contralateral side and leptomeningeal anastomoses on the cerebral surface may have served as a link for this increase in cerebral blood flow. Moreover, occlusion on the ischemic side may have led to the dilatation of the contralateral vasculature as a compensatory mechanism. This dilatation beyond physiological limits increases vessel fragility, and finally causes the ruptures of small vessels. Regarding case 2, the hemodynamic changes due to occlusion of ICA may also have participated in the pathogenesis of cSAH. In addition, we considered that emboli from the heart may have clogged the ipsilateral vessels and caused infarction. Moreover, these emboli may have damaged already highly dilated contralateral vasculature in the arterial border zone, leading to cSAH. Nevertheless, the precise mechanism by which this occurs remains unclear. Generally, antithrombotic treatment is suggested for patients with infarction. However, the increased risk of cerebral hemorrhage or SAH due to antithrombotic therapy cannot be ignored. There is no consensus on the treatment for acute ischemic stroke co-occurring with cSAH. Few studies suggest that antithrombotic agents are safe for patients with this condition who have large artery stenosis or occlusion. Antiplatelet or anticoagulation drugs did not seem to influence the outcome in our two cases. Both patients had a good prognosis which is consistent with the literature. Our case reports suggest that contralateral cSAH can occur alongside acute ischemic stroke caused by atherosclerotic ICA occlusion and cardioembolic stroke. cSAH did not lead to poorer outcomes in our patients.'},\n",

Routine laboratory finding is non-specific. She complained that right side subjective weakness and mild sensory numbness. However, The National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was 0. Initial computed tomography angiography at one and half hours after symptom onset demonstrated subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) localized in the left frontal convexity and mild focal stenosis at both A2 segments. Also the Magnetic resonance diffusion-weighted images (DWI) revealed an acute infarction of anterior cerebral arterial territory (Fig. 1).

MRI also reveals that no evidences of acute infarction in DWI and hemorrhagic transformation in susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) (Fig. 2). DISCUSSION Although the prevalence of non-traumatic convexal SAH is reported to be 7.5% of all spontaneous SAH patients, little has been conscious of concerning the incidence of CSAH accompanying with acute infarction among many different etiologies of CSAH. Cuvinciuc et al. demostrated the image protocol to cover the wide spectum of entities potentially responsible for CSAH that brain CTA with a paired channel at both arterial and venous phases and MR imaging including GRE T2 sequences, FLAIR, DWI, MRA 3D TOF, contrast-enhanced venogram, and pre- and postgadoliniumT1-weighted imaging. However, We evaluated the CTA and MR imaging cluding T2, DWI, SWI and 3D TOF MRA. these work-up tests were enough to distinguish the etiolgies of CSAH. CTA and MRA are useful to determine the vascular causes of CSAH such as vascular malformations, RCVS, vasulitides, high-grade stenosis, moyamoya disease, and septic aneurysms. In addition, MR imging is ascertainable diagnositic tools between dural and cortical CVT, and non-vascular causes such as, CAA, PRES, neoplasm, abscess and cavernoma. In this case, ACA territory infarction seemed to occur hemodynamically because of stenotic lesion on A2 segment and hypoperfusion on brain SPECT with Tc-99 m HMPAO. Nakajima et al. assumed that the accompanying an infarction and non traumatic CSAH might demonstrate that hemodynamic insufficiency because of arterial stenosis or occlusion get to the critical point. For instance, after an acute infarction due to occlusive disease by the embolic or hemodynamic mechanism, ensuing dynamic changes of intracranial perfusion pressure might bring about the CSAH. Also Cuvinciuc et al. explained that the main mechanism of CSAH because of chronic arterial occlusive diseases is considered to be the rupture of dilated vulnerable compensatory pial vessels. Antiplatelet treatment is suggested for patients who have suffered the infarction. A large randominzed controlled trial studied Clopidogrel and Aspirin in High-Risk Patients with Acute Nondisabling Cerebrovascular Events (CHANCE) was finished in china. The result revealed that antiplatelet double therapy with clopidogrel plus aspirin was better than aspirin alone for reducing the risk of recurrent stroke and not increase the risk of bleeding among patients with high risk transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor infarction Due to our patient's acute hemorrhage on the frontal convexity, we were concerned the hemorrhagic transformation and rebleeding because dual antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel plus aspirin) was associated with a significant trend to increase moderate bleeding. So we treated with cilostazol plus aspirin successfully. The patient's symptom was improved and there was no evidence of rebleeding on following studies. Tan et al. reported that cilostazol, alone or with aspirin, decrease recurrence of ischemic stroke significantly, poststroke intracranial hemorrhage, and extracranial bleeding in patients with a prior ischemic stroke as compared with other antiplatelet treatments. Cilostazol, a selective inhibitor of cyclic nucleotidephosphodiesterase 3, increases activated intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations and thus inhibits platelet aggregation.\"},\n",

Three days after her hospitalization, she complained about her impaired motor function of the left upper extremity and deterioration of the verbal ability and mental state. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed a dotted low density in the region of her basal ganglia and radiate corona. Subsequent digital subtraction angiography (DSA) discovered an occlusion in the M2 segment of the right middle cerebral artery, and the Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) value was 7. An endovascular thrombectomy was performed. The modified treatment in cerebral ischemia (mTICI) score was graded 2a. The CT scan after the thrombectomy showed low density in right temporoparietal lobe, whereas the CT scan 24\\xa0h after the thrombectomy showed HT in the right temporal lobe. The HT was classified as parenchymal hematoma type 2 (PH2), which is associated with worse clinical outcome. The patient was intubated in the local hospital for hypoxemia. The National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 28 before intubation. Since the onset of the hemorrhagic event, warfarin was discontinued and no INR reversal was utilized. The patient was transferred from the local hospital to our unit one day after her HT occurrence. On admission, the patient was mechanically ventilated (pO2 at 69\\xa0mmHg with FiO2 at 40%, without the assistance of ventilator), with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 4T (E2VTM2).

       "  'chunk': \"D: Anteroposterior (AP) view DSA showing no evidence of any aneurysms, AVM, fistula, or other vascular pathologies. SICH: Spontaneous Intracranial Hemorrhage; DSA: Digital Subtraction Angiography; FLAIR: Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery; MRA: Magnetic Resonance Arteriography; MRV: Magnetic Resonance Venography; AVM:\\xa0Arteriovenous Malformation Supportive therapy did not significantly improve the features of raised intracranial pressure (ICP)(vomiting,\\xa0headache, blurred vision, sleepiness) in our patient. With evident clinical worsening (GCS: 10/15), such as\\xa0vomiting,\\xa0headache, blurred vision, sleepiness, and imaging evidence of progressive raised ICP and potential herniation sequelae, immediate neurosurgical consultation was obtained. The neurosurgical team went for craniotomy with tubular evacuation of the hematoma; consequently, the patient improved. There was also improvement seen in the mass effect on uncus as depicted in\\xa0Figure 1C. Discussion SICH coexisting with subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage is very rare with only one case reported till now. Based on our recent review of the literature, this would mark the second instance of such a case being documented. Rather there are case reports of SDH combined with SAH but without SICH in the literature. Moreover, this will be the first case report explaining the temporal lobe being the infrequent site for bleeding in SICH. Less common etiologies for SICH include:\\xa0hypertensive vasculopathy and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), AVM, cerebral venous thrombosis, hemorrhagic infarction, bleeding disorders, sickle cell disease, cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome, cerebral vasculitis, Moyamoya disease, mycotic intracranial aneurysm, central nervous system infection, and primary or metastatic tumor. Old age, hypertension, and the use of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy are the major risk factors for spontaneous ICH. Other risk factors include obesity, high alcohol intake, race, ethnicity, tobacco use, stimulant drug use, infections, and small vessel vascular disease. The proposed hypothesis of the presence of concomitant SICH, SAH, and SDH can be found in the literature. SDH and SAH may accompany SICH when there is bleeding through the cortical surface that expands into the subdural space. SICHs involving lobar regions and concomitant SDH have been linked to cerebral amyloid angiopathy. SAH caused by a ruptured cerebral aneurysm may extend into the subdural space and this occurs in approximately 0.5% up to 7.9% of cases. Rarely, aneurysm rupture results in discrete SDH without obvious SAH\\xa0. Rarely, a cortical surface rupture of an arteriovenous malformation, arteriovenous fistula, or cavernous malformation will present as an isolated acute SDH\\xa0. Stretching of the arachnoid layer, which is attached to the AVM can result in direct bleeding into the subdural region, which is exacerbated by brain movement. Similarly, blood from a pia-arachnoid rupture that is high flow could extravasate into the subdural area. Last but not least, SDH may also be brought on by a ruptured bridge artery, a cortical artery that runs between the cortex and the dura layer. To summarize, there are five mechanisms listed in the literature that can cause SDH combined with SICH and SAH: (I) adhesion of the aneurysm to the arachnoid membrane because of minor successive hemorrhages; (II) extension and then erosion of the aneurysm in the cavernous sinus; (III) laceration of the arachnoid membrane because of high-pressure hemorrhage; (IV) an ICH that tears the brain tissues and possibility of an aneurysm in the subdural carotid artery directly resulting in a hematoma  Patients who have severe brain atrophy are more likely to develop SDH due to rupture of the bridging veins between the brain's dural membrane and cortical surface. A history of chronic alcohol misuse, being older, and having experienced a traumatic brain injury are all risk factors for developing cerebral atrophy. In those patients, insignificant head trauma or even a pure whiplash injury without a physical impact may result in an SDH. Senile cortical atrophy due to SDH and CAA leading to lobar hemorrhage (SICH) is possible in our patient. However, it is also possible that the hematoma or surrounding edema might have obscured and confused the evaluation of any potential structural pathology. After the bleeding and edema have subsided in these situations, delayed imaging may be used to find patients who have underlying structural abnormalities and are at a greater risk of experiencing SICH recurrence. Management of SICH requires immediate triage with aggressive care in the ICU or stroke unit with a focus on the management of acute bleeding, anticoagulant reversal, blood pressure management, and managing hemorrhagic expansion with intra-cranial pressure management. ICP monitoring with clinical features, invasive or imaging modalities is very crucial in the management of SICH. In most patients general and medical therapy for ICP management is sufficient. Emergent surgical intervention may be needed in some patients of SICH with clinical evidence of or concerning imaging features for rapidly progressive neurological dysfunction due to raised ICP. This was true for our case. Surgery to remove a hematoma in the case of supratentorial ICH is debatable since, in many instances, the risks associated with the procedure may outweigh any potential advantages (STICH). The patient subset that might benefit from surgical treatment has not been firmly established. The surgical intervention is reserved in most of the centers for patients who have supratentorial ICH that poses a life-threatening mass effect, and treatment plans are personalized based on assessments of the prognosis with and without surgical therapy. In our patient, craniotomy with tubular evacuation of the hematoma led to improvement in the symptoms and prevented the potential life-threatening herniation sequelae based on clinical examination. In the International Surgical Trial in IntraCerebral Hemorrhage (STICH) trial of 1033 patients with supratentorial ICH, those who had early surgical hematoma evacuation had similar favorable outcome rates as those who received maximum medical therapy. A trend toward favorable outcomes was observed among patients assigned to early surgery who had craniotomy as opposed to alternate techniques and in those with hematoma located 1 cm or less from the cortical surface. In the STICH II trial when comparing patients who received surgery to conservative care, the unfavorable functional outcome was similar at six months. However, individuals who received early surgery showed a trend toward lower mortality. Surgery was linked to lower mortality and a trend toward improved functional outcomes was observed in a systematic review that included 15 trials with more than 3000 patients with SICH, the benefit was greatest for people with worse prognoses at the time of presentation, people who got worse after they presented, and people who had superficial ICH without intraventricular extension. Supratentorial hematoma evacuation may decrease mortality in patients who are unconscious, have a big hematoma(\\xa0thickness greater than 10 mm or a\\xa0midline shift\\xa0greater than 5 mm on computed tomographic (CT) scan) with a major midline shift, or have excessive ICP that is resistant to medical therapy. Although it may lower mortality, supratentorial decompression with hematoma evacuation and/or decompressive hemicraniectomy does not necessarily lead to better functional outcomes. Even in these situations, judgments should be made individually. It should only be regarded as a life-saving operation to treat resistant increases in ICP. The most extensively researched surgical procedure for patients with supratentorial ICH is open craniotomy with craniectomy. Other procedures involving a craniotomy include minimally invasive surgical interventions like CT-guided stereotactic aspiration, endoscopic hemorrhage aspiration, and fibrinolytic treatment to remove the hematoma before aspiration. Minimally invasive surgical intervention is selected in some cases to address symptoms, large hemorrhage volume with midline shift, and peri-hemorrhagic brain edema with a primary goal to decrease mortality over functional outcomes. Management is still controversial between surgical and medical arms with more data about survival in minimally invasive brain approaches  Conclusions SICH involving the temporal lobe and concomitant with SAH and SDH is a rare entity. However, clinicians should be cautious as SICH can occur without hypertension, trauma, or ruptured AVM. With debatable benefits between conservative and surgical intervention, judgments should be made individually. Surgical evacuation of the hematoma should only be regarded as a life-saving operation to treat resistant increases in ICP. In all cases, conducting a comprehensive evaluation is essential, as it can assess the presence of intracerebral hemorrhage or surrounding swelling, which may impede and complicate the assessment of any underlying structural abnormalities that could be responsible for SICH.

       "  'chunk': 'We analyzed the probable reasons and put forward thoughts from ourselves. Introduction Intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) for acute ischemic stroke within 4.5 h after the onset of symptoms, using recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rtPA) with the recommended dose of 0.9 mg/kg, is a standard therapy and recommended by various trials and guidelines. However, the appropriate dose is still being controversial considering the balance of effectiveness and safety. Some studies showed that low-dose rtPA was comparable with the standard-dose treatment in terms of effectiveness. In contrast, someone indicated that standard-dose intravenous rtPA could achieve more favorable outcome without increasing the risk of symptomatic hemorrhage than low-dose rtPA. Moreover, comparing with IVT, mechanical thrombectomy (MT) has been proved to be more effective for acute ischemic stroke with large vessel occlusion (AIS-LVO) due to the high rates of successful recanalization (modified TICI 2b–3 grades). The subgroup study of HERMES collaboration suggested that the effects favoring the intervention was significant in those not receiving intravenous alteplase. Therefore, the major controversy is that whether it is necessary to perform IVT before MT for AIS-LVO within the thrombolytic time window. We reported two cases of AIS-LVO that was treated by only IVT, and the dose of intravenous rtPA was controlled individually according to their timely angiography results. Case 1 Images of case 1. a Non-contrast CT: a hyperdense right MCA (black arrow). b Cerebral angiography: occlusion of the M1 segment of right MCA from frontal image. c Cerebral angiography: occlusion of the M1 segment of right MCA from lateral image. d Cerebral angiography: spontaneous recanalization of the M1 segment of right MCA before endovascular intervention. e Cerebral angiography: thrombus moving to MCA bifurcation 5 min later (black arrow). f Cerebral angiography: thrombus disappeared (black arrow) and complete recanalization of the right MCA. g Dyna-CT image: no hemorrhagic transformation. h Follow-up non-contrast CT at 24 h after IVT: right thalamus hemorrhage A 67-year-old male presented with sudden left limbs deficit was admitted to our hospital at 33 min after symptom onset. Non-contrast head CT was performed immediately (multimodal CT scan was not available at that time) and revealed no intracranial hemorrhage but with high- density on the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) M1 segment (Fig. 1a). The National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scored 14, and the patient was treated with IVT (rtPA 0.9 mg/kg × 78 kg) that followed by digital subtraction angiography (DSA). The first image of DSA showed that the right MCA M1 segment was occluded with a score of American Society of Interventional and Therapeutic Neuroradiology collateral grading (ACG) system 3 (Fig. 1b and c). However, the M1 segment was recanalization 6 min after the first DSA image, and the residual thrombus had immigrated to the M2 segment (Fig. 1d and e). Fortunately, the vessel achieved complete recanalization after another 5 min without any endovascular treatment in the whole process (Fig. 1f). Therefore, IVT was terminated in advance with a total dose of 42 mg (3/5 standard-dose, 0.54 mg/kg individually). The door-to-needle time (DNT), door-to-puncture time, onset-to-needle time, and onset-to-reperfusion time were 30 min, 58 min, 63 min, and 106 min, respectively. Immediate result of Dyna-CT scan (Artis zee biplane, Siemens, Germany) confirmed no intracranial hemorrhage (Fig. 1g), and the NIHSS score decreased to 1 at 24 h. However, asymptomatic intracranial hemorrhage in the infarction area was detected by the non-contrast CT imaging at 24 h, with class 3 of the Heidelberg Bleeding Classification (Fig. 1h). Finally, the modified Rankin Score (mRS) of the patient at 90 days was 0.

       " {'chunk': 'Left Atrial Appendage Closure: A Safe and Effective Alternative to Anticoagulation? To date, left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) devices continue to be assessed as an intuitive alternative to oral anticoagulant therapy to prevent embolic complications in patients with atrial fibrillation. Concerns remain about the up-front risks associated with device implantation as well as device efficacy in preventing embolic events as compared with anticoagulation. Currently, LAAC devices serve as a potential alternative to long-term anticoagulation with the benefit of decreased bleeding risk but with less protection against ischemic events. An individualized risk–benefit analysis with regard to stroke possibility, bleeding likelihood with long-term anticoagulation, the risks of an invasive procedure, and the risks associated with having a lifelong intracardiac device should be performed to guide careful patient selection for this operation. Introduction The association between atrial fibrillation (AF) and stroke is well-established, as is the efficacy for reducing stroke with oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy. On the basis of largely post-hoc analyses, the left atrial appendage (LAA) is believed to be the major source of thrombus leading to AF-associated embolic strokes. Currently, LAA closure (LAAC) devices are being assessed in an ongoing manner as an intuitive alternative to OAC therapy to prevent embolic events while lessening the risk of hemorrhagic complications. However, there are concerns about the upfront risks associated with device implantation as well as device efficacy in preventing embolic events as compared with anticoagulation. Percutaneous approaches to LAAC include implantable devices that occlude the LAA orifice, such as the WATCHMAN™ device (Boston Scientific Corp., Natick, MA, USA) and the AMPLATZER™ Amulet™ (Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, IL, USA) as well as the LARIAT® device (SentreHEART, Redwood City, CA, USA), a soft-tissue snare that cinches the LAA epicardially. In the United States, the WATCHMAN™ device (Boston Scientific Corp., Natick, MA, USA) is currently the only commercially available LAAC device and gained Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval following results from two multicenter randomized control trials (RCTs) and their associated continued access registries. The FDA indication for this device is to reduce the risk of thromboembolism from the LAA in patients with nonvalvular AF (NVAF) who (1) are at increased risk for stroke and are recommended for anticoagulation therapy, (2) do not have a contraindication to warfarin, and (3) have an appropriate reason to seek a nonpharmacologic alternative to warfarin. The road to Food and Drug Administration approval The first Watchman RCT, the Watchman Left Atrial Appendage System for Embolic Protection in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation (PROTECT AF) study, randomized 707 patients with NVAF and a CHADS2 score of 1 or greater in a 2:1 ratio to either a WATCHMAN™ (n = 463) group or a warfarin (n = 244) group. The use of the WATCHMAN™ device (Boston Scientific Corp., Natick, MA, USA) was found to be noninferior to warfarin for the primary composite efficacy endpoint of stroke, systemic embolization (SE), and cardiovascular/unexplained death, both at 1,065 (mean: 1.5 years) and 2,621 patient-years (mean: 3.8 years) of follow-up. This finding was driven by lower rates of hemorrhagic stroke and fatal hemorrhagic stroke in the device arm. The hemorrhagic stroke incidence was 10 times higher in the warfarin arm than in the device arm at 1.5 years (2.5% versus 0.2%) and 3.8 years (4% versus 0.6%). Additionally, the rate of cardiovascular/unexplained death was lower in the device arm, with an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 5.3% at 3.8 years. This was driven by the lower rate of fatal hemorrhagic stroke in the warfarin arm (p = 0.004), as eight of the 10 hemorrhagic strokes were fatal. Notably, several issues were raised with regard to the hemorrhagic stroke signal in PROTECT AF. FDA reviewers noted an uneven adjudication of hemorrhagic stroke between the study arms. Of the 10 hemorrhagic stroke events in the warfarin arm, five occurred after falls, four were associated with a subdural hematoma (SDH), and one was associated with a subarachnoid hemorrhage. In current guidelines, hemorrhagic stroke is by definition not caused by trauma. In the WATCHMAN™ arm, three subjects also fell and had SDH; however, these cases were categorized as intracranial bleeding events rather than hemorrhagic stroke. In total, there were five reported intracranial bleeding events in the WATCHMAN™ group and one in the warfarin group. Combining the reported hemorrhagic strokes with intracranial bleeds, there were seven events in the WATCHMAN™ group and 11 events in the warfarin group. Although in the study protocol, hemorrhagic stroke diagnosis required imaging confirmation, one control subject did not have imaging confirmation, but the reporting physician deemed it likely she had experienced such. Another control arm patient, although appropriately included in the intention-to-treat analysis, had been off warfarin for more than 38 months at the time of the hemorrhagic stroke and was taking acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) alone. Four control group patients were taking ASA in addition to warfarin at the time of the hemorrhagic event, making it difficult to assess the contribution of the concomitant antiplatelet (APT) medication. Lastly, the hemorrhagic stroke incidence in the warfarin arm of PROTECT AF, at 1.1 per 100 patient-years, was at least two times higher than the hemorrhagic stroke risk of warfarin in contemporary OAC trials, where the incidence has been consistently 0.4 to 0.5 per 100 patient-years. To this end, the signal toward reduced hemorrhagic stroke with the WATCHMAN™ device (Boston Scientific Corp., Natick, MA, USA) is attenuated by the inconsistent adjudication of hemorrhagic stroke events, the lack of imaging confirmation in one subject, the concomitant use of APT medication in several subjects with hemorrhage, the small sample size leading to potentially spurious results, and the significantly higher rate of hemorrhagic stroke in the warfarin arm as compared with in recent OAC trials. The lower rate of cardiovascular/unexplained death, fatal hemorrhagic stroke, and overall lower hemorrhagic stroke rate in the WATCHMAN™ arm was not reproduced in the later Evaluation of the WATCHMAN™ LAAC Device in Patients with AF versus Long-term Warfarin Therapy (PREVAIL) trial. The hemorrhagic stroke rate in the PREVAIL control group (0.67 per 100 patient-years) was in the range observed in the warfarin groups of contemporary OAC trials. Embolic event rates are the usual comparator in AF therapies and have been consistently higher with use of the WATCHMAN™ device (Boston Scientific Corp., Natick, MA, USA) versus with warfarin. The rates of ischemic stroke for the device and drug arms were 5.2% (24/463) versus 4.1% (10/244) at 3.8 years, and three SE events occurred in the device arm only. Combining ischemic stroke and SE events, warfarin had an ARR of 1.7% at 3.8 years. Early in the PROTECT AF study, several ischemic strokes were caused by air emboli, which improved with operator experience. When excluding procedural ischemic events, the ischemic events in PROTECT AF were not statistically different between the WATCHMAN™ and warfarin groups. However, skepticism was raised regarding the low-risk patient population. The average CHADS2 score was just 2.2 and more than 30% of patients had a CHADS2 score of 1, which may have made it easier to establish noninferiority for the composite endpoint. There was also concern that the concomitant use of antithrombotic medications and indefinite ASA played a role in the already modest efficacy observed in the WATCHMAN™ arm. Although the FDA had reservations about efficacy, the main concern was the early adverse event rate of 8.7% within seven days of implant. Because of safety events that occurred early on in the trial, use of the WATCHMAN™ device (Boston Scientific Corp., Natick, MA, USA) was deemed inferior to warfarin in terms of the primary safety endpoint, a composite of major bleeding or procedure-related complications, at 1.8 years, but it did meet noninferiority at 3.8 years. The PREVAIL trial was the second RCT to consider the WATCHMAN™ device (Boston Scientific Corp., Natick, MA, USA) and was designed in part to address these concerns. The focus of PREVAIL was to demonstrate that safety improvements observed during the second half of the PROTECT AF trial could be reproduced and successfully adopted by new centers. PREVAIL had similar enrollment criteria as those of the PROTECT AF study but included higher-risk patients, presented a mean CHADS2 score of 2.6, and excluded patients with an indication for long-term clopidogrel therapy. Bayesian statistical methods allowed an efficacy composite to be studied in what was planned to be a smaller trial incorporating PROTECT AF data with a discounted weight of 50%. As it turned out, warfarin was superior to the WATCHMAN™ device (Boston Scientific Corp., Natick, MA, USA) for the PREVAIL trial’s composite primary efficacy endpoint of stroke, SE, and cardiovascular/unexplained death. Patients using the device had higher rates of each of the following events in comparison with those using warfarin: ischemic stroke (1.9% versus 0.7%), hemorrhagic stroke (0.4% versus 0%), death (2.6% versus 2.2%), and SE (0.4% versus 0%). The total number of events, however, was still very small; for example, the number of ischemic strokes/SE in the device arm was six of 269, versus one of 138 in the warfarin arm. The second primary efficacy endpoint in PREVAIL was “late” ischemic stroke or SE occurring at greater than seven days after randomization. This was intended to answer the proof-of-concept questions, “is the LAA the source of embolism in NVAF?” and “do LAAC devices offer the same protection from ischemic events as OAC after overcoming the procedural risks?” Although the late ischemic event signal was higher in the device group (2.53%) versus the drug group (2%), the 18-month risk difference was statistically noninferior. In the July 2014 publication of PREVAIL, only 28% of patients were reported to have reached the planned 18-month follow-up point. Updated data released later revealed eight additional ischemic strokes in the device arm, for a total of 14 ischemic events (5.2%), versus one event (0.7%) in the warfarin arm. Of the 14 ischemic events, only one was caused during the procedure; thus, these new results suggested that the WATCHMAN™ device (Boston Scientific Corp., Natick, MA, USA) was now inferior to warfarin for the proof-of-concept late ischemic endpoint. The trialists suggested that PREVAIL was not powered to detect differences in ischemic stroke and pointed to PREVAIL’s overperforming warfarin arm (0.34 events/100 patient-years) as the reason for the difference. However, when comparing the ischemic stroke risk seen with the WATCHMAN™ device (Boston Scientific Corp., Natick, MA, USA) to that with the warfarin arms of contemporary OAC trials with similar CHADS2 scores, the risk with device use was still greater at 2.3 events per 100 patient-years versus between one event and 1.4 events per 100 patient-years for warfarin. A patient-level meta-analysis combining the two RCTs further assessed the signals of increased ischemic stroke in the WATCHMAN™ (n = 732) arm as compared with in the warfarin arm (n = 382). The meta-analysis results were unsurprisingly similar to the results of the 3.8-year follow-up of the PROTECT AF trial, which provided the majority of patient data. At a mean follow-up of four years, the pooled primary composite endpoint met noninferiority. Participants in the device arm had higher rates of ischemic stroke and SE (45/732; 6.1% versus 14/382; 3.6%), but the difference was not statistically significant. The difference in hemorrhagic stroke was, however, significant in a manner that favored the device arm (5/732; 0.6% versus 13/382; 3.4%; p = 0.002). Notably, the hemorrhagic stroke events were driven entirely by PROTECT AF; thus, the concerns about the hemorrhagic stroke signal raised by the FDA still apply here. In addition, there were significant differences in disabling stroke (1.8% versus 3.9%; p = 0.03) and all-cause mortality (14.5% versus 19.1%; p = 0.02), driven by the difference in fatal hemorrhagic stroke in PROTECT AF, as well as in nonprocedural major bleeds (6.5% versus 13.3%; p = 0.003), respectively, favoring the device. When including procedural bleeding, major bleeds were similar between the groups. Despite the signal toward increased ischemic stroke/SE with use of the WATCHMAN™ device (Boston Scientific Corp., Natick, MA, USA), PREVAIL was not powered to demonstrate individual efficacy endpoints and the meta-analysis did not show a statistical difference. The prime directive for PREVAIL was to satisfy the safety concerns raised in PROTECT AF, which it successfully did; specifically, the composite of early procedure-related complications decreased to 4.2% in PREVAIL. This improvement and the totality of data from the RCTs was sufficiently convincing enough that the third FDA panel voted in favor of approval for the WATCHMAN™ device (Boston Scientific Corp., Natick, MA, USA) in March 2015 and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services subsequently agreed to pay for the procedure. The most frequent serious complication seen in PROTECT AF, cardiac tamponade, improved from a rate of 4.3% in PROTECT AF to 1.9% in PREVAIL and then to 1.02% in safety monitoring data following FDA approval of the device. The rates of procedure-related stroke (0.18%), device embolization (0.25%), and procedure-related mortality (0.06%) also improved significantly.',\n",

Hemorrhagic stroke comprises 10-20% of strokes. Here, we present a case report of hemorrhagic stroke that may have been secondary to untreated Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) in a young man\\xa0with no other cardiovascular risk factors or features of metabolic syndrome. A\\xa032-year-old man\\xa0was admitted for hemorrhagic stroke. An initial thorough workup for the etiology of stroke was inconclusive. Eventually, a polysomnography was done, which demonstrated OSA suggesting that untreated OSA may have contributed to his stroke. OSA may cause hemorrhagic stroke by nocturnal blood pressure surge. So, all physicians should consider doing polysomnography for unexplained hemorrhagic stroke or in patients at risk. Diagnosing and treating OSA would be critical in preventing hemorrhagic stroke and its recurrences. Introduction Stroke is the second common cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide; hemorrhagic stroke contributes to 10-20% of all strokes. Hypertension is a well-established risk factor for hemorrhagic stroke. In some patients, the etiology remains unclear and bizarre. This is a report on one such patient, who did not have any apparent risk factors. The association between ischemic stroke and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been known since 1999 and several studies have examined the relationship between OSA and ischemic stroke using the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) as the measurement tool. The AHI measures the severity of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) by the number of apnea and hypopneas per hour of sleep. Here we describe a case of hemorrhagic stroke possibly caused because of untreated OSA in the absence of any risk factors. Case presentation A 32-year-old Chinese man presented to the emergency department at 3 AM, with weakness and inability to mobilize resulting in a fall. His symptoms began as a sudden onset of left-sided headache, which started four hours earlier during sexual intercourse. Following this, he developed right-sided weakness, facial droop and two episodes of vomiting. The weakness was profound four hours later, resulting in an inability to walk, which subsequently led to a fall. On examination, body mass index was 23.3 kg/m2 and blood pressure (BP) was 135/93 mm Hg. He was drowsy but rousable, Glasgow Coma Scale score was 11/15 [E4V1M6]. Pupils were symmetric and equally reactive to light. The extra-ocular range of movement was full, with no nystagmus. Motor power on the left was 5/5 in both upper and lower extremities. Best motor power in the right upper extremity was 2/5, while in the lower extremity it was 1/5.',\n",

Hemorrhages have classically been described as a contraindication for mechanical thrombectomy. However, the natural course of a large vessel occlusion with or without decompressive hemicraniectomy is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This paper investigates the origin of the contraindication for mechanical thrombectomy, the natural history of large vessel occlusion, risks of craniectomy, and risks of mechanical thrombectomy. Given the likelihood of poor outcomes without intervention, mechanical thrombectomy could be considered in select individuals, but future studies into the natural course of contralateral ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes would better guide management. Introduction Strokes is the number one cause of adult disability and the fourth leading cause of death in the United States with costs in 2009 both direct and indirect totaling around $68.9 billion. Strokes impact approximately seven million individuals in the United States, about 3% of the adult population. However, not all strokes are created equal. Approximately 87% of strokes are ischemic with the remaining being hemorrhagic. Mortality rates associated with ischemic strokes are approximately 57.4%\\xa0with a subset of those with proximal vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation having a 60-80% mortality in 90 days or inability to regain functional independence. Acute ischemic stroke care has evolved over time with studies proving the benefits of acute intervention, such as intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular thrombectomy which can significantly improve a patient’s functional outcome.

The complexity of this case was magnified by the patient’s young age, a mechanical heart valve (MHV), and a need for anticoagulation to maintain MHV patency in a setting of potentially life-threatening intracranial hemorrhage. Anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy are risk factors for hemorrhagic conversion post-cerebral ischemia; however, the pathophysiology underlying endothelial cell dysfunction causing red blood cell extravasation is an active area of basic and clinical research. The need for randomized clinical trials to aid in the creation of standardized treatment protocol continues to go unmet. Consequently, there is marked variation in therapeutic approaches to treating intracranial hemorrhage in patients with an MHV. Unfortunately, patients with an MHV are considered at high thromboembolic (TE) risk, and these patients are often excluded from clinical trials of acute stroke due to their increased TE potential. The authors feel this case represents an example of endothelial dysfunction secondary to microthrombotic events originating from an MHV, which caused ischemic stroke with hemorrhagic conversion complicated by the need for anticoagulation for an MHV. This case offers a definitive treatment algorithm for a complex clinical dilemma.',\n",

       " {'chunk': '(C) Occlusion (arrow) of the M1 segment of the left MCA (D) and successful recanalization of TICI 3. Discussion Anticoagulation management in patients with atrial fibrillation is a delicate balance between preventing thromboembolism and minimizing the risk of hemorrhagic complications. Our case highlights this clinical challenge, particularly in the context of acute ischemic stroke. The self-discontinuation of apixaban in our patient precipitated an initial ischemic stroke, which was effectively managed by MT. However, he later suffered from a bilateral MCA occlusion after withholding apixaban due to a minor hemorrhagic conversion. The early start of anticoagulation after an ischemic CVA can increase the risk of hemorrhagic transformation. This risk is especially high in patients with large infarcts, elevated blood pressure, cardioembolic etiologies, and those who received thrombolytic therapy. The resultant intracerebral hemorrhage can lead to significantly worse neurological outcomes, including increased disability and mortality. Individuals with a CHA2DS2-VASC score of 9 have a 12.2% annual risk of ischemic CVA, and oral anticoagulation provides a 75% relative risk reduction. Furthermore, the risk of recurrent stroke is elevated in the initial 4-week period. Factors such as blood-brain barrier breakdown, impaired cerebral autoregulation, and increased local inflammation may contribute to an increased risk of hemorrhagic transformation after an ischemic event. Therefore, the resumption of anticoagulation must be based on a careful determination of risks and benefits. Few cases of bilateral MCA occlusions requiring MT have been reported in the literature. Story et al reported the case of a 64-year-old woman who had AF and held apixaban for 5 days before a cerebral angiogram who developed bilateral MCA occlusions. The patient underwent successful bilateral MT with TICI 3 revascularization. Current strategies to determine the resumption of anticoagulation after an ischemic CVA include both an imaging-based and clinical approach. The rule “1-2-3-4 days” adopts a clinical approach based on the NIHSS to determine when to start direct oral anticoagulation (DOAC). This study involved a cohort of 1797 patients derived from a Japanese stroke registry that determined that early initiation of DOAC within 1, 2, 3, or 4 days was reasonable to decrease the risk of recurrent CVA, but also a major bleeding event. The “1-2-3-4 day” rule recommends the following: (a) Mild stroke (NIHSS < 8) DOAC initiation 2 days after the event. (2) Moderate stroke (NIHSS 8–15) DOAC initiation 3 days after the ischemic event and after evaluating for hemorrhagic transformation on CT or MRI on the same day of initiation. (3) Severe stroke (NIHSS > 16) DOAC initiation 4 days after the ischemic event and after evaluating for hemorrhagic transformation on CT or MRI on the same day of initiation. Taking this study into account, the ideal time to restart apixaban in our case was appropriately delayed given the hemorrhagic conversion. In clinical practice, caution is exhibited due to limitations and complicating factors when only using a clinical-based marker such as the NIHSS when making decisions. For example, many patients are admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) after a CVA and develop superimposed delirium that can artificially inflate the NIHSS. The TIMING trial is a Swedish registry-based cohort study of 888 patients that determined that early initiation of DOAC was not inferior to delayed start after acute ischemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. In 2020, a survey with 238 responses from stroke specialists in the United States (ACT-SAFe) was completed on the best practices of reinstatement of anticoagulation after an ischemic stroke. For a mild ischemic stroke occupying <1/3 of the MCA territory without hemorrhagic conversion or thrombolysis, 51% of the respondents chose to anticoagulate within the first 4 days. In patients with a large MCA territory stroke (>1/2 MCA territory), evidence of hemorrhagic conversion or cerebellar infarct > 60 ccs, 65% of the respondents chose to wait at least 7 days before starting anticoagulation. In addition, a prior study determined that individuals with an ischemic stroke with AF would benefit from DOAC initiation without bridging therapy. Prior clinical trials have also established that DOACs are just as effective as vitamin-K antagonists (e.g. Coumadin) at preventing recurrent AF-related ischemic stroke. Close monitoring, including frequent neurological checks, is a cornerstone of effective management in patients who have had an acute ischemic stroke, especially when anticoagulation has been paused. Regular assessments allow healthcare providers to quickly identify any neurological changes that may indicate the onset of recurrent stroke or hemorrhagic conversion. These checks often involve repeated measures of consciousness, motor strength, language, vision, and other neurological functions using standardized tools such as the NIHSS. In addition, close monitoring can guide the timing of when to safely reintroduce anticoagulation, as any sign of clinical stabilization or improvement may indicate a lower risk for hemorrhagic conversion. This case encourages further research on optimal strategies and standardized international guidelines for anticoagulation management in the context of recent cerebral infarction to minimize both ischemic and hemorrhagic risks. These guidelines should incorporate both clinical and imaging data to provide an individualized approach, tailoring decisions based on factors such as the patient’s age, overall health status, stroke severity, and specific imaging findings like the size of the infarct or the presence of hemorrhagic conversion. The guidelines would also benefit from including clear protocols on when and how to safely discontinue and resume anticoagulation. The development of such guidelines would contribute significantly to standardizing care, reducing variability in treatment approaches, and potentially improving patient outcomes. Future randomized controlled studies that incorporate both clinical and imaging-based strategies to determine the optimal timing of anticoagulation in ischemic CVA with AF are needed. Despite the complexity of his clinical course, the outcomes of our patient were favorable, in part, due to the prompt recognition of his condition and the immediate intervention with thrombectomy. However, his residual symptoms underscore the potential severity of the neurological sequelae of such events. In addition, this case emphasizes the vital importance of patient education and compliance with anticoagulant medication. The temporary cessation of apixaban may have contributed to the development of the first and subsequent ischemic strokes of the patient. Hence, ensuring that patients understand the critical importance of consistent anticoagulant use is essential to prevent similar instances. This case serves as a valuable lesson for clinicians in managing similar future cases. Conclusions In the management of patients with atrial fibrillation, it is critical to balance the prevention of thromboembolism and mitigation of hemorrhagic risk, particularly in the setting of acute ischemic stroke. The impact of discontinuing anticoagulation, as illustrated in this case, can be severe and life-threatening. Prompt intervention with mechanical thrombectomy proved vital in managing acute stroke events in this patient, with a relatively favorable outcome despite multiple cerebral infarctions. This case underscores the need for patient education on the importance of medication compliance and highlights the need for further research into optimal anticoagulation management strategies in the context of a recent cerebral infarction.

Furthermore, this case highlights the effectiveness of mechanical thrombectomy in minimizing this rare bilateral occlusive event of the large cerebral vessels.

Her hospital course consisted of observation in the ICU and blood pressure management. The case illustrates that intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) can sometimes present indolently and does not always require surgical intervention. Introduction Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) accounts for 15% of all strokes and 50% of stroke-related mortality, which equates to approximately 2.8 million deaths globally every year. In 2010, hemorrhagic strokes accounted for nearly a third of 33 million stroke cases and had a mortality rate of just over 50% worldwide. Two major risk factors for ICH are age and anticoagulant use. The overall increase in life expectancy means a larger aging population, which translates to an increased incidence of ICH. ICH is more prevalent in older persons, and older persons are also more likely to be on an anticoagulant agent. Other risk factors for ICH are being part of non-white ethnicity, being male, older age, and having familial apolipoprotein syndromes. Other risk factors also include cerebral amyloid angiopathy, uncontrolled or untreated hypertension, and drug abuse (i.e.'},\n",

       "  'chunk': 'A Case Report Examining a Contraindication for Mechanical Thrombectomy in the Setting of a Large Vessel Occlusion and a Concurrent Contralateral Intracranial Hemorrhage An acute ischemic stroke occurring contralateral to a hemorrhagic stroke is an uncommon occurrence that presents unique challenges. Hemorrhages have classically been described as a contraindication for mechanical thrombectomy. However, the natural course of a large vessel occlusion with or without decompressive hemicraniectomy is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This paper investigates the origin of the contraindication for mechanical thrombectomy, the natural history of large vessel occlusion, risks of craniectomy, and risks of mechanical thrombectomy. Given the likelihood of poor outcomes without intervention, mechanical thrombectomy could be considered in select individuals, but future studies into the natural course of contralateral ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes would better guide management. Introduction Strokes is the number one cause of adult disability and the fourth leading cause of death in the United States with costs in 2009 both direct and indirect totaling around $68.9 billion. Strokes impact approximately seven million individuals in the United States, about 3% of the adult population. However, not all strokes are created equal. Approximately 87% of strokes are ischemic with the remaining being hemorrhagic. Mortality rates associated with ischemic strokes are approximately 57.4%\\xa0with a subset of those with proximal vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation having a 60-80% mortality in 90 days or inability to regain functional independence. Acute ischemic stroke care has evolved over time with studies proving the benefits of acute intervention, such as intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular thrombectomy which can significantly improve a patient’s functional outcome.

       "  'chunk': 'Computed tomography-negative symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage in a patient with cerebral small vessel disease Abstract Rationale: Computed tomography plays a key role in the initial evaluation of suspected acute stroke by ruling out the possibility of hemorrhage before thrombolysis. Recently, many reports have described cases of symptomatic microbleeds, and there may also have been a case of computed tomography- negative intracerebral hemorrhage. Patient concerns: A 70-year-old female patient who had a history of lacunar infarction and severe small vessel disease developed dysarthria. On brain non-contrast computed tomography there was no evidence of intracerebral hemorrhage. However, brain magnetic resonance imaging performed at 3\\u200ahours after the initial computed tomography showed cerebral hemorrhage. Diagnoses: The diagnosis was computed tomography-negative intracerebral hemorrhage. Interventions: The patient was treated with cilostazole 100\\u200amg twice a day with blood pressure management. Outcomes: The dysarthria was fully recovered within 5 days and the patient did not suffer recurrent stroke symptoms over the following 2 years. Lessons: In patients with underlying severe small vessel disease and microbleeds, there could be computed tomography-negative hemorrhage and susceptibility weighted magnetic resonance image could be needed. More attention is required before applying thrombolysis therapy because there is a possibility of cerebral hemorrhage in those patients. Introduction Stroke is an emergent disease which results in death and severe disability. However, in many cases it can be reversed by timely treatment such as intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular thrombectomy. Thus, prompt diagnosis and treatment are necessary to minimize stroke-induced disability, and brain imaging plays a major role in determining treatment strategy. Non-contrast brain computed tomography (NCCT) is commonly used to differentiate hemorrhage from ischemia because it takes a short time and has high sensitivity for detecting cerebral hemorrhage. Intravenous thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is first line treatment in ischemic stroke patients who present within 4.5\\u200ahours. However, hemorrhagic complications were found to develop in 21.3% of patients and symptomatic hemorrhage in 5.6%. Once hemorrhagic complications occur, neurologic symptom may deteriorate and patients may have poor outcomes. Thus, intravenous thrombolysis should only be undertaken after careful examination of early brain images for signs of potential hemorrhagic. The authors encountered a case of a patient with acute cerebral hemorrhage in whom early brain NCCT gave no evidence of bleeding but magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated hemorrhage. Ruling out cerebral hemorrhage by brain CT may be insufficient, especially in patients with a history of severe small vessel disease and lacunar infarction. We describe this case with emphasis on the need for caution in employing intravenous thrombolysis in such patients.

She had been diagnosed with hypertension 11 years previously and took regular medication.

       "  'chunk': \"Outcome measures used in this patient are the Functional Independence of Measures (FIM) scale, Brunnstrom\\xa0grading, voluntary control grading, and the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). Introduction Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is the term used to describe any bleeding that takes place inside the intracranial vault, which comprises the brain parenchyma and surrounding meningeal spaces. Epidural hemorrhage, subdural hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and intraparenchymal hemorrhage are the four main kinds of intracranial bleeding. It can be difficult to differentiate between ICH and an ischemic stroke in acute presentation. The symptoms of an ICH rather than an ischemic stroke include coma, headache, vomiting, seizures, neck stiffness, and high diastolic blood pressure (BP), but only neuroimaging can make a definitive diagnosis. Stroke patients must first improve their general physical condition and fundamental daily living skills before improving their hand movement and hand muscle strength for instrumental activities of daily living training\\xa0. Similar to ICH without an underlying lesion, there is typically little evidence to recommend surgically removing the hemorrhage. Reflex-inhibiting movement patterns by Bobath assure\\xa0that normal tone is maintained in the affected limb and the development of abnormal movement patterns is prevented. She also says that for complete rehabilitation, incorporating the affected upper limb into all everyday tasks is essential. Unfortunately, like with all motor remediation theories, empirical data supporting the use of this approach is still inconclusive. When a blood artery inside the brain or between the skull and brain bursts, it causes an intracranial hematoma. The brain tissue is compressed by blood accumulation (hematoma). Brain tissue is compressed by the hematoma, a blood clump. A cerebral hematoma is potentially life-threatening and frequently requires rapid treatment, but some head injuries, such as those that merely result in momentary loss of consciousness\\xa0may be minor. CT scans are extremely useful for diagnosing hematomas. Generally, clinicians assume that progressive loss of consciousness associated with a head injury can be attributed to bleeding in the skull. In this latter group, the majority of the study on the advantages of surgery has been conducted. To remove the blood, surgery is frequently but not always necessary for cerebral hematomas. In a decompressive craniectomy (DC), a section of the skull is cut away to provide space for enlarged brain tissue. Although it has been used for many years to manage patients with brain edema and/or intracranial hypertension, its current use in therapy is debatable. Patients with malignant middle cerebral artery stroke have higher survival rates after DC, but some of them still experience moderate-to-severe impairment. When treating individuals with diffuse traumatic brain damage, an early (neuroprotective) DC is not more effective than standard medical care. Stroke places a tremendous burden on health resources worldwide. The incidence of stroke is currently substantially greater in India than in Western industrialized nations. In stroke, only a few possible symptoms include headache, nausea, convulsions, and localized or generalized neurologic problems. Deep structures are more prone to experience hypertension-related ICH, and as BP increases, the risk of ICH increases as well. Other risk factors for ICH include heredity, alcohol use, and low total serum cholesterol levels. Due to stroke, the patient's\\xa0quality of life gets affected as it has a direct\\xa0impact on\\xa0health systems; serious disabilities and functional limitations lead to compromised quality of life. Case presentation Patient information The 45-year-old female patient came to the hospital with flaccidity of the right upper and lower limbs. Bed mobility was very challenging for her. There were no sensory issues or deformities. Previously, she was affected by strokes twice, for which she underwent medical and physiotherapy treatment in the early stages. She had been taking medicine for her hypertension for the past two years. Now, after two years, she was affected by the same condition and got admitted in July for further treatment. On investigation, the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\\xa0revealed an area of blood density attenuation with multiple air foci in the left gangliocapsular region. An intracranial hemorrhage was observed on a CT scan of the brain. In this case, she underwent a decompressive craniotomy. After 36 hours of monitoring in the intensive care unit (ICU), she was shifted to the surgery ward for further management. Clinical findings In terms of time, place, and people, the patient was orientated. The vital signs were as follows: temperature 95.5 °F, BP\\xa0130/79 mmHg, pulse 63 beats per minute, respiration rate 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 98%. On neurological assessment, the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scored 7 as severe. A score of 30 was also determined as severe by the NIHSS. According to the modified Rankin scale (mRS), the patient scored\\xa05. The affected right upper limb and right lower limb were supported with a pillow. Ryle’s tube was attached for feeding.

       "  'chunk': 'There was not much difference in initial hematoma volume on CT scan (28.6 mL for group A, and 25 mL for group B). Interestingly, three patients showed progression of hematoma without evidence of rebleeding from a clipped aneurysm. This is why we concluded that remaining hematoma itself is a major triggering factor for progression of cerebral swelling. Removal of hematoma in case 2 was relatively easier than case 1. Massive hematoma enabled simple suction procedure in operation. In contrast, it was impossible because of arachnoid adhesion and sticky hematoma in case 2. Brain retraction to remove hematoma and small vein coagulation for bleeding control would aggravate progression of secondary cerebral brain swelling on POD 2. According to Jickling et al., a delayed hemorrhagic transformation occurs after 18 to 24 hours of stroke onset for several weeks, and the mechanism contributes to the processes involved in delayed blood-brain-barrier (BBB) opening after stroke. Removal of the blood clot in the intrasylvian hematoma is very difficult. Unlike hypertensive ICH that results from small lenticulostriate arteries and forms the global hematoma capsule and homogeneous character, intrasylvian hematoma consists of blood clot, thick arachnid trabecular, fibrin, and brain debrides. It is impossible to remove by simple aspiration, and, sometimes, coagulation and removal with brain retraction may be necessary.'},\n",

       "  'chunk': 'observed an incidence of 8% infarcts in their cohort of 212 patients with SICH. Prabhakaran et al. detected a 22.9% prevalence of associated infarcts as evidenced by diffusion-weighted image (DWI) abnormalities in a cohort of 118 SICH patients. The majority of these infarcts, however, were small subcortical and subclinical. Large vessel occlusion causing malignant cerebral infarction has been rarely reported. We add a case of vermian hematoma with infarct to our earlier reported two cases of malignant infarction following evacuation of a supratentorial SICH. Several mechanisms have been postulated to explain the possible occurrence of an infarct following a spontaneous hematoma. The majority of such infarcts are small and subcortical, conforming to border-zone or single perforator territories. Few recent studies have observed subclinical DWI lesions in 15% of patients with acute intracerebral hematoma (ICH) attributable to cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Since both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke share common risk factors and certain common pathogenic mechanisms, it is possible that an ischemic stroke may simply be a co-occurrence in the presence of common risk factors. Hypotension due to attempted aggressive reduction of BP following a hypertensive bleed may precipitate an ischemic event. Surgery for evacuation of the hematoma may be associated with intraoperative hemodynamic instability, which can result in an ischemic event. Though unlikely, infarcts following craniotomy may also be attributable to iatrogenic compression of vascular structures during craniotomy or through the durotomy defects. Large hematomas with surrounding edema can theoretically directly compress the adjacent cerebral vessels causing ischemia. Infection with persistent fever, dehydration, and electrolytic imbalance can all result in a hypercoagulable state following a bleed and can result in ischemia. One another postulated mechanism for ischemia is the massive release of blood and blood breakdown products into the CSF and subsequent inflammatory changes in the smooth muscle of the large cerebral arteries. Cerebral vasospasm, due to the presence of concomitant intraventricular hemorrhage or after indirect vessel manipulation at the time of craniotomy, is another suspected mechanism for ischemia. After acute brain injury, autoregulation may be abolished such that cerebral blood flow is linearly related to cerebral perfusion pressure. Aggressive BP lowering beyond the lower limits of cerebral autoregulation might induce cerebral ischemia in chronic hypertensive ICH patients. Our patient did not undergo surgery and the infarct and hematoma were located in different compartments. He did develop features of early sepsis while under treatment for vermian hematoma. Sepsis with an associated hypercoagulable state may be the precipitating factor resulting in the infarct. Attempts have been made to predict the risk of developing concomitant infarcts in patients with SICH. Wang et al. observed that the presence of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), hydrocephalus, the volume of intracranial hematoma, and neurosurgical intervention were important predictors of infarction of which IVH had the most statistical significance. Similarly, Prabhakaran et al. observed that the factors independently associated with DWI abnormality were a prior ischemic stroke, lowering of mean arterial pressure by over 40%, and craniotomy for ICH evacuation. Our patient did have the evidence of fourth ventricular blood but did not satisfy most of the above criteria. The rarity of such complications makes it less likely to appear in our clinical diagnosis and we feel one should consider this scenario as well. The remote site hemorrhages which are often encountered after tumor or hematoma decompressive surgery are shown in Table 1. The varied cases of remote site bleed following tumor excision and decompression The exact etiopathogenesis of these large infarcts remains uncertain and the management of such large infarcts needs to be on similar lines as for any ischemic infarct. The outcome, however, is usually grave. Conclusion Stroke physicians need to be aware that SICH patients have a potential threat of developing large vessel occlusion with malignant cerebral infarcts, especially after surgical decompression. Although the exact pathogenesis is unknown, size of the clot, IVH, hydrocephalus, and aggressive reduction of BP appear to be predictive factors. Financial support and sponsorship Nil.'},\n",

Transthoracic echocardiography showed rheumatic heart disease with severe aortic stenosis and decreased left ventricular diastolic function. The ischemia was classified as ICA occlusion due to cardioembolic stroke. Warfarin was initiated after 2\\u2009weeks. Three months later, she underwent elective aortic valve replacement and continued long-term warfarin therapy. She could self-care after a follow-up period of 6\\u2009months and had modified Rankin Scale of 2. Discussion and conclusions Nontraumatic SAH is mainly caused by aneurysm rupture, but not all cases have an aneurysmal origin. cSAH is a rare and heterogeneous entity, and is characterized by bleeding along the cortical convexity. The prevalence of cSAH is reported to be 5–18% of all spontaneous SAH. Diverse causes of cSAH have been described including CAA, reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS), posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, ICA stenosis or occlusion, cerebral venous thrombosis, drug misuse, vasculitis, vascular malformation, brain tumors and abscesses. cSAH may occur simultaneously with acute ischemic stroke, but this co-occurrence is particularly rare. There are various reasons for this association, such as ICA stenosis or occlusion, artery dissection, RCVS, CAA, and cardioembolism. However, the most common cause of cSAH with acute ischemic stroke is ICA stenosis or occlusion. Moreover, cSAH has been described to occur invariably on the side with acute ischemic stroke, and it is notably unusual for cSAH to occur on the opposite side of the infarct territory. To date, there have been few reports about infarction with contralateral cSAH caused by RCVS, ICA dissection, embolic stroke of undetermined source, and CAA. This paper presented two cases of acute ischemic stroke with contralateral cSAH due to ICA atherosclerotic occlusion and cardioembolic stroke, respectively. The pathophysiology of the association between acute ischemic stroke and cSAH is not fully understood. The current leading theory suggests that cSAH may occur in the setting of severe atherosclerotic stenosis or large artery occlusion, potentially by a mechanism similar to hemorrhage caused by moyamoya disease, the acute alteration in hemodynamics may lead to cSAH. Plaque rupture leads to further atherothrombotic narrowing, while acute hypertension results in the spontaneous rupture of fragile collateral vessels. Further, another theory suggests that emboli to marginally perfused vessels can cause necrosis and rupture. In case 1 in our study, ICA occlusion had an influence on the hemispheric cerebral blood flow of both the occluded and contralateral sides. We speculate that increased contralateral leptomeningeal flow towards the occluded side may have caused cSAH. The establishment of collateral circulation can lead to hemodynamic changes on the contralateral side and leptomeningeal anastomoses on the cerebral surface may have served as a link for this increase in cerebral blood flow. Moreover, occlusion on the ischemic side may have led to the dilatation of the contralateral vasculature as a compensatory mechanism. This dilatation beyond physiological limits increases vessel fragility, and finally causes the ruptures of small vessels. Regarding case 2, the hemodynamic changes due to occlusion of ICA may also have participated in the pathogenesis of cSAH. In addition, we considered that emboli from the heart may have clogged the ipsilateral vessels and caused infarction. Moreover, these emboli may have damaged already highly dilated contralateral vasculature in the arterial border zone, leading to cSAH. Nevertheless, the precise mechanism by which this occurs remains unclear. Generally, antithrombotic treatment is suggested for patients with infarction. However, the increased risk of cerebral hemorrhage or SAH due to antithrombotic therapy cannot be ignored. There is no consensus on the treatment for acute ischemic stroke co-occurring with cSAH. Few studies suggest that antithrombotic agents are safe for patients with this condition who have large artery stenosis or occlusion. Antiplatelet or anticoagulation drugs did not seem to influence the outcome in our two cases. Both patients had a good prognosis which is consistent with the literature. Our case reports suggest that contralateral cSAH can occur alongside acute ischemic stroke caused by atherosclerotic ICA occlusion and cardioembolic stroke. cSAH did not lead to poorer outcomes in our patients.'},\n",

The patient's neurological finding was improved on day 2. She has done well for a follow-up period and her Modified Rankin Scale was 0 at day 5. The follow-up evaluation was performed at out-patient clinic after 5 months. CTA shows that the SAH was washed out and encephalomalatic change in left ACA territory. MRI also reveals that no evidences of acute infarction in DWI and hemorrhagic transformation in susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) (Fig. 2). DISCUSSION Although the prevalence of non-traumatic convexal SAH is reported to be 7.5% of all spontaneous SAH patients, little has been conscious of concerning the incidence of CSAH accompanying with acute infarction among many different etiologies of CSAH. Cuvinciuc et al. demostrated the image protocol to cover the wide spectum of entities potentially responsible for CSAH that brain CTA with a paired channel at both arterial and venous phases and MR imaging including GRE T2 sequences, FLAIR, DWI, MRA 3D TOF, contrast-enhanced venogram, and pre- and postgadoliniumT1-weighted imaging. However, We evaluated the CTA and MR imaging cluding T2, DWI, SWI and 3D TOF MRA. these work-up tests were enough to distinguish the etiolgies of CSAH. CTA and MRA are useful to determine the vascular causes of CSAH such as vascular malformations, RCVS, vasulitides, high-grade stenosis, moyamoya disease, and septic aneurysms. In addition, MR imging is ascertainable diagnositic tools between dural and cortical CVT, and non-vascular causes such as, CAA, PRES, neoplasm, abscess and cavernoma. In this case, ACA territory infarction seemed to occur hemodynamically because of stenotic lesion on A2 segment and hypoperfusion on brain SPECT with Tc-99 m HMPAO. Nakajima et al. assumed that the accompanying an infarction and non traumatic CSAH might demonstrate that hemodynamic insufficiency because of arterial stenosis or occlusion get to the critical point. For instance, after an acute infarction due to occlusive disease by the embolic or hemodynamic mechanism, ensuing dynamic changes of intracranial perfusion pressure might bring about the CSAH. Also Cuvinciuc et al. explained that the main mechanism of CSAH because of chronic arterial occlusive diseases is considered to be the rupture of dilated vulnerable compensatory pial vessels. Antiplatelet treatment is suggested for patients who have suffered the infarction. A large randominzed controlled trial studied Clopidogrel and Aspirin in High-Risk Patients with Acute Nondisabling Cerebrovascular Events (CHANCE) was finished in china. The result revealed that antiplatelet double therapy with clopidogrel plus aspirin was better than aspirin alone for reducing the risk of recurrent stroke and not increase the risk of bleeding among patients with high risk transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor infarction Due to our patient's acute hemorrhage on the frontal convexity, we were concerned the hemorrhagic transformation and rebleeding because dual antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel plus aspirin) was associated with a significant trend to increase moderate bleeding. So we treated with cilostazol plus aspirin successfully. The patient's symptom was improved and there was no evidence of rebleeding on following studies. Tan et al. reported that cilostazol, alone or with aspirin, decrease recurrence of ischemic stroke significantly, poststroke intracranial hemorrhage, and extracranial bleeding in patients with a prior ischemic stroke as compared with other antiplatelet treatments. Cilostazol, a selective inhibitor of cyclic nucleotidephosphodiesterase 3, increases activated intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations and thus inhibits platelet aggregation.\"},\n",

Three days after her hospitalization, she complained about her impaired motor function of the left upper extremity and deterioration of the verbal ability and mental state. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed a dotted low density in the region of her basal ganglia and radiate corona. Subsequent digital subtraction angiography (DSA) discovered an occlusion in the M2 segment of the right middle cerebral artery, and the Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) value was 7. An endovascular thrombectomy was performed. The modified treatment in cerebral ischemia (mTICI) score was graded 2a. The CT scan after the thrombectomy showed low density in right temporoparietal lobe, whereas the CT scan 24\\xa0h after the thrombectomy showed HT in the right temporal lobe. The HT was classified as parenchymal hematoma type 2 (PH2), which is associated with worse clinical outcome. The patient was intubated in the local hospital for hypoxemia. The National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 28 before intubation. Since the onset of the hemorrhagic event, warfarin was discontinued and no INR reversal was utilized. The patient was transferred from the local hospital to our unit one day after her HT occurrence. On admission, the patient was mechanically ventilated (pO2 at 69\\xa0mmHg with FiO2 at 40%, without the assistance of ventilator), with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 4T (E2VTM2). Blood tests on the day of her admission revealed the presence of hypoalbuminemia (serum albumin 31.9\\xa0g/L, normal range: 44–55\\xa0g/L) and a slightly elevated level of B-type natriuretic peptide (163\\xa0pg/ml, normal range: 5–100\\xa0pg/ml). Her platelet counts (90 × 109/L, normal range: 125 × 109/L to 350 × 109/L), hemoglobin level (96\\xa0g/L, normal range: 130–175\\xa0g/L), and hematocrit (29.1%, normal range: 40–50%) were decreased. The level of antithrombin III (AT III, 46.0%, normal range: 103.2–113.8%) was reduced, and the levels of D-dimer (8.37\\xa0μg/ml, normal range: <0.5\\xa0μg/ml) and fibrin(-ogen) degradation product (FDP, 19.5\\xa0mg/L, normal range: 0–5\\xa0mg/L) were elevated.

       " {'chunk': 'A Case Report Examining a Contraindication for Mechanical Thrombectomy in the Setting of a Large Vessel Occlusion and a Concurrent Contralateral Intracranial Hemorrhage An acute ischemic stroke occurring contralateral to a hemorrhagic stroke is an uncommon occurrence that presents unique challenges. Hemorrhages have classically been described as a contraindication for mechanical thrombectomy. However, the natural course of a large vessel occlusion with or without decompressive hemicraniectomy is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This paper investigates the origin of the contraindication for mechanical thrombectomy, the natural history of large vessel occlusion, risks of craniectomy, and risks of mechanical thrombectomy. Given the likelihood of poor outcomes without intervention, mechanical thrombectomy could be considered in select individuals, but future studies into the natural course of contralateral ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes would better guide management. Introduction Strokes is the number one cause of adult disability and the fourth leading cause of death in the United States with costs in 2009 both direct and indirect totaling around $68.9 billion. Strokes impact approximately seven million individuals in the United States, about 3% of the adult population. However, not all strokes are created equal. Approximately 87% of strokes are ischemic with the remaining being hemorrhagic. Mortality rates associated with ischemic strokes are approximately 57.4%\\xa0with a subset of those with proximal vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation having a 60-80% mortality in 90 days or inability to regain functional independence. Acute ischemic stroke care has evolved over time with studies proving the benefits of acute intervention, such as intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular thrombectomy which can significantly improve a patient’s functional outcome. The following is a case that demonstrates the nuance in a broad guideline that merits further investigation.',\n",

At the moment of admission, the patient only agreed to a minimally invasive surgery. She was informed in detail about all risks, side effects, and alternatives as well as the potential risk for an emergency open abdominal surgery. Before surgery, we performed imaging diagnostics by means of computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen ().\\nWhen performing a hysterectomy of a very large uterus (>2500 g), the anatomical changes in the abdomen caused by the size of the uterus need to be taken into account. The large uterus divides the abdominal area, and only 3 narrow spaces are left to manipulate surgical instruments: between the left uterine wall and left abdominal wall, between the right uterine wall and right abdominal wall, and between the fundus uteri and liver and diaphragm. Successful surgery is only feasible when both instruments (forceps and coagulator or scissors) are in the same space simultaneously. Hence, we performed LASH with the “changeover technique” as described previously []. As such, we inserted 6 trocars including 3 on the left: one trocar in the lower, one in the middle, and one in the upper abdomen, allowing access to the left narrow space ().\\nThe 3 trocars on the right side were placed in a mirror-like fashion. Surgery was initiated at the patient's left side, using the upper left trocar to introduce the camera () and the other two left-located trocars to introduce forceps and coagulator or scissors.\\nThe patient was slightly tilted to the opposite side to facilitate visualization and preparation of structures. For uterus manipulation and movement, we used blunt forceps and palpation probes. After parameterization and resection of the uterine adnexa on the patient's left side, the plica vesicouterina was exposed and the bladder was pushed caudally.\\nNext, the surgeon and his team switched sides positioning to the right side of the patient, thus accessing the narrow space on the right side in between the right uterine wall and right abdominal wall (). Again, the patient was slightly tilted to the opposite side, enabling better exposure and preparation of organ structures.\\nThe procedure continued analogically as on the left side. As was seen on the CT scan, multinodal, intraligamentary, and parametric myomas were found on the right side. Consequently, further exposure and protection of the ureter was done by visualizing followed by preparing or abscising the right adnexa, parametria, and blood vessels ().\\nThe corpus uteri were removed from the abdominal cavity by power morcellation. The entire procedure lasted 4 hours and 53 minutes, of which surgery on the uterus took 2 hours and morcellation 2 hours and 53 minutes. No postoperative complications occurred, and the patient was taken to outpatient care 2 days after surgery. Before discharge, a vaginal and renal ultrasound did not reveal any conspicuous intra-abdominal findings. Because of the young age of our patient, a very slow growth of the leiomyoma (over 14 years), and negative Doppler test results before surgery, we assumed no presence of malignancy. Histological analysis of the removed specimen confirmed this assumption. Furthermore, to prevent morcellation-induced spreading of occult malignancy, the patient was alternately tilted from a head-down to head-up position, after which we extensively rinsed the abdominal cavity with Ringer's lactate solution, a routine postsurgical measure at our facility. The total weight of the uterus was 4065 g (Institute for Pathology PPO Berlin; Mona Tawfik, M.D.; 06.05.2014).\""
